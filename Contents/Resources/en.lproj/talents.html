<p>You have been blessed by a god of war. You receive a special bonus of +10 to your St, Qu, Ag, and Co stats bonuses. You may cast one spell per day from the <a href="spells.html#SL_2.5.3">Holy Arms</a> spell list (maximum of your current level); no Power Points are required for this casting. There is a 10% chance per month (non cumulative) that you will be "quested" to carry out some mission for your god. You may roll an RR versus a tenth level <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> attack (if you wish to resist), but if you resist the quest, you will lose all of your special bonuses from this talent, and be at -15 to all actions for one year. In addition, you will be labeled a heretic, and probably chased down by another champion of your former god (vengeance from a god of war is not often pretty). If the concept of a war god does not fit into your background or the GM's world, the powers and source may be modified; the GM should select four stats and one spell list that would be appropriate for his world.</p>
<blockquote>You were taken to the temple of the war god at a very early age and given to him as a servant. The war god looked down at you and smiled. He decided to grant you one of the greatest blessings of all: to be one of his personal Champions! Since that day, you have been imbued with great power. You have been preaching the values and sermons of your god, and destroying those who would oppose him. Occasionally, you are commanded to fulfill some task for your god, but thaI is a small price to pay for the power that you wield.</blockquote>

<p>You have a friend in a helpful place. If you need a favor or some information, he will provide it to you to the best of his ability. This is helpful because you cannot be everywhere at once, or know everything that is going on. Your contact is one of your best tools in solving a mystery. You have a contact that is in a powerful position and can pull strings for you or provide a vast amount of information for you, provided that you can communicate with him. You must determine who the contact is and how you know him, subject to the GM's approval. The cost of a contact is dependent on the contact's power and range of influence.</p>

<p>This is a contact (greater) who will help you, but only under duress or through coercion. Perhaps the uncooperative contact is a rival who owes you something, a criminal who is plea-bargaining for a reduced sentence, or someone who is helping you under the threat of violence. To get help from an uncooperative contact, you must give them reason to do so and offer them some service, potential reward, or punishment. You must determine why the contact is uncooperative and what is required to secure their assistance, subject to GM's approval.</p>

<p>The character sometimes has glimpses into the future. Up to once per day (at the GM's discretion), the character will see into the near future (as per an <em>Intuitions V</em> spell).</p>
<h5>From Talent Law</h5>
<p>You instinctively know the direction that will take you to a specific goal. This ability can only be used once per day.</p>
<h5>From Nightmares of Mine</h5>
<p>The ability to see into the future is not an unalloyed blessing in the horror genre; such visions are often horrific and grotesque. These visions are a wonderful resource for the gamemaster who wants to creep the players out in advance. If a character has a vision of being swarmed by rats, for example, every scratch and skitter in the wainscoting will make the players jump. The origin of the character's prophetic gifts should be explicated, and might also make a useful character hook.</p>
<blockquote>You view your life as a river, constantly flowing to a specific point. The river may make bends and it may even fork, but the current continue to flow in the proper direction. When you come across a situation where you have no idea what to do next, you like to relax and feel the flow of your life around you. If you concentrate hard enough, you call see which way will lead you to your goal.</blockquote>

<h5>From Talent Law</h5>
<p>You can emit a stunning force from your body. When you purchase this ability, you must pick how you can stun your opponent (e.g., bright light, loud sound, etc.). When you use your power, everyone in a 10' radius must make an RR versus an <span id="essence">Essence</span> attack (with your level as the attack level). If the RR fails, the victim is stunned and unable to parry for 1 round per 10% failure. This attack can affect comrades within the area of effect if they are not prepared for it (allies can prepare to get a special bonus of +10 to their RR). After the stun attack is used, it takes one hour to "recharge" the ability (until it is recharged, the ability cannot be re-used)</p>

You opened your eyes and noticed the bear looked stunned. You took advantage of this condition and ran away as fast as you could. That was the first time you discovered your talent. You can summon forth a bright flash of light, apparently powerful enough to stun an enraged grizzly bear. It takes time to recharge your flare but when it's ready, you can stop the most determined attacker.</blockquote>

You can make yourself invisible with just a thought, easily walking the halls of a guarded prison or beside the guards protecting the royal treasure. You must still be careful not to make much noise. You must be very careful not to injure yourself or anyone else, as that would make you visible. When you do not wish to be seen, you are not.</blockquote>

The total amount of the bonus is directly related to how closely your current actions will affect the outcome of your goal (most of your bonuses will be at +5, the final +15 bonus should only come when you are near the completion of your goal). Realize that this is a goal that has driven you for most of your life. You have not thought about much else for years. When you have accomplished this goal, if you do, you will probably have a sense of deprivation and a loss of direction.</p>

<p>You have the power to control the mind of other sentient beings. Each use of this power costs 4d10 exhaustion points. Your victim must make an RR versus a <span id="mentalism">Mentalism</span> attack (using your level as the attack level). The RR is modified by how alien the mental command is to the victim. For example: a command that the victim would not mind doing might be modified by a -20. If the command is something the viclim is against doing, the RR for the victim might be modified by +10. If the command is completely foreign, like suicide or blinding oneself, the RR might be modified by +50. Each time a new command is given, the victim gets a new RR. The range for Mental Control is 5' per level.</p>
<blockquote>You know how to dominate weak minds. You just force your will upon them, and they do as you command. It is a power that you sought long and hard for. It is also a power for which you paid dearly. You have dealt with the archmages, demons, and even a lich to find part of the secret to mind control. You paid a high price, but now few can withstand you. A commanding thought is all it takes to make a person change their mind.</blockquote>

<h5>From Talent Law</h5>
<p>You can scan an area with your mind to find an individual. You must have some knowledge the person you are looking for, someone you have met, a picture, something they have touched, or a detailed description. The closer you are to the person you are scanning for, the greater bonus you would receive when you scan. For example, if you are searching for your child, spouse, or someone equally as close, you might receive a special bonus of +30 bonus. If you are friends with the person, you might receive a special bonus of +10. lf you have casually met the person you are scanning for, there would be no bonus . If you are scanning for someone you have never met, through an item they once possessed, the penalty might be -20. The smaller the area you search, the better your chances of success. You roll d100 (open-ended) to search for your target. If you exceed 100. you have detected the individual and know their approximate distance and bearing. You may develop the skill of <a href="skills.html#Mental_Scan">Mental Scan</a> (as a skill in your <a href="skillcat.html#Awareness_Searching">Awareness &bull; Searching</a> skill category). Your roll is also modified by the area you are tryinging to scan. A small area containing about a dozen people is an Easy maneuver (+20). Scanning an area around a square mile with about 100 people is a Hard maneuver (-10). Scanning a large area with many thousands of people (like a city) is an Extremely Hard maneuver (-30). Scanning an entire country is an Absurd maneuver (-90). The closer you get to the individual you are scanning for, the more precise your directions to him are. You may increase your chances of finding someone by scanning a normally large area a few people at a time. For example, you might start in a city by scanning just a tavern at a time. Each use of this power costs d10 exhaustion points.</p>
<blockquote>You are skilled at finding people. No matter how well they are hidden, you can detect their presence. If you know who you are searching for, you can use your mind to ferret them out. You have earned quite a reputation for finding people. You enjoy locating lost children or finding merchant caravans that have been captured.

<p>You have natural claws, talons, spikes, pinchers, beaks, or other weapons that you can use to attack. You may use these as a weapon, developing skill in it as if it were any other weapon (except the skill with this weapon/attack is actually under the <a href="skillcat.html#Special_Attack">Special Attack</a> category). Natural weapons in your hands do not grant you any additional bonus if you are using a weapon in that hand. Your attack is rolled on the appropriate attack table with a maximum result of Medium. This skill is classified as Everyman.</p>
<blockquote>Your race has been fond of its natural weapons. You have a nice set of retractable claws. When you need them, they pop out with lethal quickness. Your whole race has developed a fighting style based on your claws, and it is a very effective and deadly form of martial art. You are very comfortable in the knowledge that wherever you go, you go armed.</blockquote>

<p>All spell ranges are increased by 50%.</p>
<h5>From Talent Law</h5>
<p>The ranges of your spells are greater than those of most other mages. Your spells with a range of Self are actually a range of Touch. Those with a range of Touch are actually a range of 5'. All other spells add 50' to their ranges. However, this extension of range only affects one Type of spell (Force. Utility, Directed EIemental, etc.). This ability can be purchased once for every spell type.</p>
<blockquote>You have a unique perception of magic, especially when dealing with the range of a spell. Most spell users limil the range they can successfully use spells. You do not believe in such limitations. After all, the power comes from you. You have cast spells over hundreds off feet without problems.</blockquote>

<h5>From Talent Law</h5>
<p>You have a special kind of familiar. You may pick any creature (subject to the GM's approval) but it should be a creature appropriate to your background. Your bond with this creature starts at first level. You must split your experience with your familiar (thus, you gain levels slower, but you and your familiar will always be the same level). However, your familiar gains levels, new powers and abilities will be discovered (GM's discretion as to the nature of these abilities). If the familiar dies, you will be at -25 to all actions for two weeks.</p>
<blockquote>You were walking down near a river when you watched a sack wash onto the shore. You opened the sack and saw the body of what looked like a drowned animal. You were going to give the animal a proper burial when it suddenly sprang to life. A bond was formed between you and the animal and, ever since that day, it hardly leaves your side. As you two have grown older, your bond has strengthened. At first you could share the animal's sense perceptions. You instinctively know that other powers could manifest themselves given enough time. lf anything happened to your familiar, you would make whomever or whatever responsible pay dearly.</blockquote>

<p>You have a "laying on hands" ability. When you decide to aid someone, you may heal a variety of ailments. When you choose this power, you may select one ailment from the following list: lost concussion hits, bleeding, lost points of Constitution, broken bones, damaged cartilage, or nerve damage. When you choose to aid someone, you lay your hands on them (bare flesh to bare flesh), and they receive healing. You may use this power once per day foreach level of experience. When healing concussion hits or points of Constitution, the healing will restore one point per level of experience (up to the target's normal maximum). When healing bleeding, the bleeding rate will reduce by one point for every five levels of experience. When healing any other type of damage, the severity of the wound will be reduced by one for every five levels of experience (round all fractions down).

<h5>From Talent Law</h5>
<p>You may summon a creature to you at anytime. It costs 3d10 exhaustion points and d10 rounds to before the summoned creature arrives (though it only takes one round to issue the summons). You have no control over the summoned creature, but you receive a +20 to any skill that would allow you to direct the summoned creature's actions. You must determine what category of creature you may summon (e.g., woodland animals, insects, birds, fish, etc.). It is possible that no creature is available to be summoned, depending on your current location (as the creature must already exist in some nearby locale). You may use this summoning ability once per five levels of experience (round all fractions up). The summoned creature will remain nearby for at leasl an hour, or until it feels threatened (at which point it will run, back to where it was summoned from).</p>
<blockquote>You know that you would never be alone. If you needed some comrades, it was just a matter of calling them to you. You found as a child that you could actually summon creatures to do your bidding. You had many pets as a child, calling them when you felt the need. Not everything you summoned did what you asked, and you have run away from many of the cratures you summoned, but it is nice to have an army of reinforcements available to you whenever the need arises.</blockquote>

Ever since then, you have vented your fristration at every one of that race that you have seen, making each one pay with blood for the death of your parents, friends, and your innocence.</blockquote>

<h5>From RMSR</h5>
<p>Sometimes the character has visions when he touches something that he has never touched before. If the character concentrates, there is a chance (GM's discration) that he will receive a "vision" of some significant event in the object's past.</p>
<h5>From Talent Law</h5>
<p>You receive spontaneous glimpses of events that are associated with a particar place, person, or item that you touch (with your bare skin). This talent is useable once per day plus one additional time per SD bonus (a negative SD bonus results in zero addilional times per day).</p>
<h5>From Nightmares of Mine</h5>
<p>Visions of the past are potentially no more comforting than Destiny Sense's images of the future. This talent is an excellent way for the gamemaster to "fill in" characters on the history behind a particular cursed item, haunted castle, or whatever. As with Destiny Sense, the origin of the character's talent might make a useful character hook in its own right.</p>
<blockquote>The first time it happened, your village was looking for a lost girl. You came across a doll she had dropped. When you picked it up, you had a vision inside your head of her running away from a wolf. You followed the direction it looked like she ran and found her shortly thereafter. Ever since, whenever you pick up an object, touch a persoll, or even concentrate on a locarion, you get a vision in your head related to it.</blockquote>

<h5>From Talent Law</h5>
<p>You may see through almost any object. You can make an <a href="skills.html#Observation">Observation</a> maneuver (at -25) to look through the things you look at. When you purchase this power, you must specify one fairly common substance (subject to GM's approval) that you cannot see through (like lead, gold, leather, etc.). Using this ability costs d10 Exhaustion Points per round.</p>
<blockquote>Walls, doors, chests, clothes they are all the same to you. If you concentrate you can see right through them. There is no need to pick the lock on an empty chest, no need to stealthily listen at the guardroom door for alerted guards. You can glance at these things, and their secrets are revealed to you. There is, however, one type of metal that you cannot seem to see through.</blockquote>
