<h2>Academic (Pulp)</h2>
<h4>Pulp Adventures:</h4>
<p>Academics are non-spell users whose main pursuit in life is the acquisition of knowledge. They ordinarily fill a non-combative role, but rely on the maxim "mind over matter" when pressed into action. Education is essential; all academics will have completed at least four years of college-based education, and should have a particular field of endeavor that they specialize in. Academics are firm believers in science and technology. Thus they have better than average skills when manipulating mechanical devices. They usually specialize in a given field, be it anything from Archaeology to Psychology to Zoology.</p>
<p>An Academic may also find himself on the other side of the chalkboard, educating the masses for the sake of humanity and culture as a teacher, or work behind the scenes as a researcher. They often revel in their lifelong passions, collecting specimens the world over for their private collections, whether a rare tome on esoteric magic or a fossil of some extinct flora or fauna.</p>

<blockquote><p>Thomas surveyed the enemy troops from his vantage point. The enemy outnumbered his own forces three to one, but the majority appeared ill-equipped levies. Ifthe levies were deprived o f the leadership o f their officers and the support of the mercenaries, their rout was inevitable. Concentrating on the minds of his underofficers, Thomas relayed the new battle plan to his subordinates.

She reflected on the horoscope that she had earlier castfor the newborn prince and the incomplete and inaccurate interpretation she hadgiven to the Council. Let the Regents believe Prince Joram would be weak-willed and unhealthy, a willing toolfor their ends, rather than their nemesis. In the east, rose the blood-red moon.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Warrior Mage</h2>
<h4>Essence Companion</h4>
<p>Warrior Mages are Semi spell users who combine the realm of Arms with the realm of <span id="essence">Essence</span>. Their base spells primarily deal with the adaptation of <span id="essence">Essence</span> spell casting to combat and survival in hostile environments. The Warrior Mage is viewed by many as an elite type of fighter, specialized in attacking enemy spell casters on their own terms.</p>
<blockquote><p>The sergeant screamed at Aelt over the roar of the flames, "Sir, we got to get out of here! The whole place is going up!" As the last of the orcs gurgled and slid off the end of Aelt's sword, he spied the Sorcerer Prince escaping up the staircase. "Take the men and headfor the moat, Sergeant, " Aelt cried in return. "I have unfinished business," he whispered to himself. He cast a quick spell to ward off the flames and hurried up into the burning keep after his sworn enemy.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Prime Stats:</strong> Empathy and Constitution</p>
