<h5>From RMSR</h5>
<p>You are constantly losing things. Every week, there is a 5% chance that you have lost some poiece of equipment.</p>
<h5>From Talent Law</h5>
<p>You have a hard time paying attention to something that is not immediately threatening. You are intensely interested in one item or idea, then you get distracted and focus on something else. You tend to ignore your surroundings when something has attracted your attention. You tend to forget things. To find an item you misplaced, or recall a conversation you recently had, you must roll 1d100 (open-ended) modified by your Me bonus. lf the result is over 100, you are successful. If you fail this roll, you cannot remember. You should role play this flaw at all times. Remember that you are neither dumb nor slow, you just have a short attention span and poor concentration.</p>
<blockquote>You always seem to misplace your belongings. There is just so much that requires your attention, it is impossible to keep track of everything. You are constantly discovering new and better ways of doing things, who could be bothered with trivialities? Now let's see, where did you leave that note you just made?</blockquote>

You have tried using magical items to cast spells but they seem to throw you into convulsions. Luckily it does not seem like every spell harms you, just certain types. You hope to find a cure someday, before this allergy kills you.</blockquote>

It seems that the onIy crealures that can smell this particular odor are of one type of animal. You may pick the type of animal, subject to the GM's approval. Whenever one such animal sees you, it will immediately attack ferociously. If you are near an animal's territory, there is a 50% chance that it, or a pack of them, will hunt you down.</p>
<blockquote>You never did seem to get along with wolves. You had always been told that a wolf would not attack a human unless it had little other choice, yet you have been attacked by wolves, often without provocation, Something about you, your smell perhaps, incites wolves to charge at you. Your presence compels no other animals to violence, only wolves.</blockquote>

<p>You have a great tendency towards violence when you are dealing with a stressrul situation. Whenever you are insulted or offended, or under stress, you may respond with a violent attack. Roll d100 (open-ended), add 40, and subtract triple your SD bonus. If the result is greater than 100, you have lost your temper. You must respond to the situation in a violent, although not necessarily fatal, action. It takes approximately d10 rounds of quiet for you to calm down and regain your composure.</p>
<blockquote>You have a short fuse. Your friends know this, and they do their best to avoid you when you are in a bad mood. Sometimes you get so mad that you have to hit someone or something. When some punk is hurling some insult at you about your sister, there is only one way to teach him a lesson. Usually you can keep your feelings under control, but when you cannot, people get hurt. You have spent more than one night in jail, prompting you to try to control your temper.</blockquote>

<p>All breakage numbers for any equipment you handle are increased by one. In addition, all breakage checks for equipment that you are using suffer a special -15 penalty.</p>
<h5>From Talent Law</h5>
<p>You tend to break equipment more often than would seem to be normal. You either force it too much, or stress it to the point where it snaps. All breakage numbers for any equipment or weapons you use are automatically increased by one. Additionally, all strength checks you make for equipment or weapons are modified by a -20.</p>
<blockquote>Sometimes you wish you had paid more attention when you were learning how to fight with a sword. You are able to wield it effectively, you have slain many enemies in battle, and there can be no doubt as to your skill with your weapon. The problem is that you never learned how to properly swing and parry. Consequently, you often find your weapon shattering against a foe or his weapon. You strain the metal more than it was made to withstand. For now, you always keep a spare sword on your back.</blockquote>

<h5>From Talent Law</h5>
<p>You must fight in an honorable and chivalrous manner. Your whole code of ethics is based on doing what is honorable and right. You will always fight fair.

<blockquote>There is much honor to be gained in battle. You live for such honor. You endeavor to receive the most honor possible by ensuring a fair fight. You do not take advantage of an unarmed foe, attack people from behind, or attack on horseback if your foe is not himself mounted. You get no satisfaction from defeating people dishonorably. You realize that not everyone fights by reasonable rules, but you know that you are made of better stock than those who do not.</blockquote>

<p>You have set rules that govern your actions. These rules are enforced only by yourself. It is a code you try to live up to. As there are many types of codes, you may choose what kind of code you follow (subject to GM approval). For example, you may always support the underdog even if you do not agree with them. If there are any enemies of yours who know of your code, they could use it against you, forcing you into a situation that you would rather avoid. You cannot do something against your personal code. If you do, you will face a serious crisis of belief. Your code of honor must contain at least three situations, and your actions in those situations. For example, a thief might only steal from people who can afford to lose money, never betray an honorable foe, and always bestow rich gifts on a lady.</p>
<blockquote>You have seen people oppressed by the iron grip of the ruling body. You strike out against the rulers; stealing money, attacking patrols, whatever you can do to help those oppressed. Any gain you receive above what you need is given to those less fortunate. It would be as unjust for you to keep their money as it is for the Prince to keep it. You have become quite popular among the common folk. The nobility view you with disrespect, however. You have chosen your life, and every life must have a code of honor to follow.</blockquote>

<p>You are very susceplible to possession. There is a 5% chance per week that you become possessed by a demon. Every week, roll a d100 (open-ended) and add 5. If the result is over 100, you are possessed sometime during that week. The GM should randomly determine a day or the week to determine when the possession occur (you won't know when exactly, but you will know that sometime within a week you will become possessed). The possession lasts for 2d10 hours. While you are possessed, your body will be constantly trying to wreak havoc and cause suffering. Your possessed body does not care who it harms and will be under GM control for as long as the possession lasts. You are fully aware of what you are doing, you just have no conlrol over it. On rare occasions when it is absolulely necessary for you to force the demon out of your body, you may make a RR versus <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> (using at attack level of 20+2d10).

<p>You do not believe in violence. You feel that it accomplishes nothing and use it only when needed. You believe in life preservation. You may fight freely. You may even start a fight. The only thing you cannot do is kill. You can neither kill your foe nor allow them to be killed. For instance, you cannot leave a bleeding foe, lure a foe into a lethal trap, allow a comrade to administer a killing blow for you, etc. If you accidentally kill someone or something, you will suffer from severe depression (-75 to all actions) for 3d10 days.</p>

There comes a time when it is necessary to protect yourself, but then you use only the minimum force needed to to escape or render the assailant harmless.

<h5>From Talent Law</h5>
<p>You have a habit that is considered repulsive by the majority of society. You may choose the habit (subject to the GM's approval). You must make a conscious effort to perform this habit whenever possible. When people notice your habit, they will tend to regard you with disdain, possibly loathing. Your habit annoys people, but does not disgust them. This habit could range from always boasting loudly to all around you, to having bad breath, to relieving yourself in public. Again, the GM has the last say on any habit.</p>

You do not carethough, you have your reasons for avoiding a bath.</blockquote>

<p>You enjoy causing pain, either mentally or physically. Whenever you can you must indulge your sadistic habits.

People react negatively to a known sadist, many will want to see you burned at the stake. Please note that this is not a "good" or "heroic" flaw for you to possess. It is more suitable for a truly evil character. The GM may prohibit characlers from choosing this option.</p>

As you grew older, animals no longer held the same fascination for you. For a while you joined the army, but then the fighting stopped, you opted to leave. Now, you look around for your next plaything, hoping to make its anguish last Ionger than your previous subject.</blockquote>

<blockquote>You remember the fight well. You hands trace absently across your face, your fingertips lightly touching the large scar on your face. It looks impressive but you remember the pain from when you received that blow. You thought you were going to die, but you survived. Eventually your face healed, but the scar remained. You have gained quite a reputation since then; people recognice you just from your scar. The recognition comes in handy, but sometime you wish you could just blend into the crowd.</blockquote>
