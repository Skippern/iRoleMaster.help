<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>Welcome to the second <em>Rolemaster Annual!</em> This section of this book will explain what this book is all about and present a summary of the major things happening in the <em>Rolemaster Standard System</em>.</p>
<h3>WHAT IS THIS BOOK?</h3>
<p>As the <em>RMSS</em> expands and evolves, many of the master tables become outdated or incomplete. In addition, duplicating old material to take into account new rules is often not effective in a given book. This book addresses those needsd.<br />
What you will find in this book are completely updated master tables (Master Development Point Tables, Master Training Package Table, Master Racial Listing, and the new Master Hieght and Weight Tables) that include all of the master from the <em><a href="5500.html">RMSR</a></em> as well as all of the book published to through the end of 1997. In addition, you will find character record sheets for the new races and professions introduced in the <em>RMSS</em> books published in 1997 (see the exceptions below). Also, some of the material publsihed in 1997 was not provided in the perforated and 3-hole drilled pages; that material is repeated here in the more convenient format. This book also contains a list of the major errata and clarifications for the <em>RMSS</em> that have been made in 1997. Finally, a complete spell skill listing record sheet has been created for spell list development.</p>
<h3>NEW RULES AND OPTIONS</h3>
<p>This section contains an overview of the some of the new rules and options that were published in 1997.</p>
<h4><a href="5700.html">BLACK OPS</a></h4>
<p>1997 saw the release of genre books for the <em>RMSS</em>. The first of these genre books was <strong>Black Ops</strong>, giving guidelines for playing in the modern era (using <em>Weapon Law: Firearms</em> for firearm rules). This book covers many different aspects of modern espionage and counter-terrorism. However, with only minor adjustments, any modern-day campaign can use the rules presented here. The professions will work with any type of game (though the training packages are mainly presented from an espionage angle). The modern-era professions in Black Ops include <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Academic,_Modern">Academic</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter,_Modern">Fighter</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Layman,_Modern">Layman</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Rogue,_Modern">Rogue</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Scientist,_Modern">Scientist</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Technician,_Modern">Technician</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Thief,_Modern">Thief</a>, and <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk,_Modern">Warrior Monk</a>. The modern-day training packages presented include Agent, Artist, Athlete, Bounty Hunter, Cleaner, Combat Medic, Field Scientist, Hacker, Intelligence Analyst, Journalist, Lawyer, Marine Pilot, Musician, Politician, Pilot, Special Forces Operative, Student, Terrorist, Theologian, and Undercover Agent. There are rules for new skills. Guidelines for handling explosives and other support weapons. Histories of various intelligence agencies and terrorist groups. And a series of adventure sugges- tions that can be the starting point for any modern-day, espionage-oriented campaign.</p>

<h4><a href="5701.html">PULP ADVENTURES</a></h4>
<p>The second genre book published for the <em>RMSS</em> was <strong>Pulp Adventures</strong>. This book presents the fascination genre of the pulps to the <em>RMSS</em>. This book is careful to explain the difference between the pulp era (a period in time) and the pulp genre (a type of story). It even has an introduction by the Pulp award winning William Murray.
Though much of the book covers adventuring in the pulp era, the aspects of the pulp story are also explored (along with suggestions for GMs who want to try and run a pulp- style story in any setting). The new rules for handling chases (a staple in any pulp-style story) have been highly acclaimed (and can be used in any setting).<br />
A list of pulp-era professions is provided (<a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Academic,_Pulp">Academic</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter,_Pulp">Fighter</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Layman,_Pulp">Layman</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Noble_Savage,_Pulp">Noble Savage</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Rogue,_Pulp">Rogue</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Technician,_Pulp">Technician</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Thief,_Pulp">Thief</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk,_Pulp">Warrior Monk</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Healer,_Pulp">Healer</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Mystic,_Pulp">Mystic</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Sorcerer,_Pulp">Sorcerer</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Bard,_Pulp">Bard</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Monk,_Pulp">Monk</a>, and <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Ranger,_Pulp">Ranger</a>). In addition, the pulp-era training packages presented include: Clergy, Cloaked Vigilante, Daredevil, Dilettante, Entertainer, Entrepreneur, Femme Fatale, G-Man, Gadgeteer, Gangster, Great White Hunter, Insidious Villian, Journalist, Mechanic, Militaria, Occultist, Pilot, Police Officer, Scientist, and Sportsman.<br />
There are details on the various aspects of life in the early 20th century (including factoids presented throughout the book in the sidebars). A Who’s Who of the era; as well as an overview of the known world of the time. Finally, there is a list of suggested reading and viewing for those inter- ested in exploring the exciting world of Pulp Adventures.</p>

<h4><a href="5602.html">MARTIAL ARTS COMPANION</a></h4>
<p>Next up for the <em>RMSS</em> was the long-awaited <strong>Martial Arts Companion</strong>. This book saw the full-blown exploration of the martial arts in the <em>RMSS</em>. Inside there are two varient professions of the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Monk">Monk</a> profession (an <span id="essence">Essence</span>-based variant, the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Taoist_Monk">Taoist Monk</a>; and a <span id="mentalism">Mentalism</span>-based varient, the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Zen_Monk">Zen Monk</a>; along with their appropriate spell lists), as well as over a dozen new training packages (most focus on an “oriental”-flavored setting). In addition, there are several new attack tables for oriental style weapons and two new critical strike tables. Descriptions of dozens of oriental-style weapons are also included (along with combat statistics for them).
The most important aspect of the <em>Martial Arts Companion</em>, however, is the changes it makes to the way martial arts works in the <em>RMSS</em>. There are some new definitions for old skills and a whole new category of skill is defined (<a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Martial_Arts_Combat_Maneuvers">Martial Arts &bull; Combat Maneuvers</a>). Most martial arts are now defined by Martial Arts Styles (that define the way in which the user fights; giving him special benefits beyond just Offensive Bonus). However, non-Martial Artists also get a bonus! There are Weapon Styles as well (a new skill in the <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Combat_Maneuvers">Combat Maneuvers</a> skill category that defines various methods of using special weapon fighting styles to gain certain advantages in combat). Finally, the mystical abilities of the mysterious <dfn>Chi Powers</dfn> are presented (allowing characters to surpass the normal bounds of human physiology to perform incredible feats).</p>
<h4><a href="5603.html"><span id="essence">ESSENCE</span> COMPANION</a></h4>
<p>The long anticipated <strong>Essence Companion</strong> fully explores the realm of <span id="essence">Essence</span> within the <em>RMSS</em>. This book presents the concept of schools of magic (though it only applies to <span id="essence">Essence</span> spell users) that allow spell users to specialize in their form of magic. Also presented are expanded rules for magic rituals and systems for learning skills.<br />
Familiars are given a full section (including exploring the new kind of familiar that is available), discussing the concepts and limitations and powers of familiars. Also, some further details on spell research is given. The new professions (<a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Runemage">Runemage</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Mana_Molder">Mana Molder</a>, and the long-awaited <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Mage">Warrior Mage</a>) are presented along with their appropriate spell lists. Sixteen new training packages (most of which focus on spell users) are also presented. The list of new spell lists is quite extensive (inclduing 14 new training package spell lists, six new <span id="essence">Open Essence</span> spell lists, 11 new <span id="essence">Closed Essence</span> spell lists and 18 new profession base lists). Master tables for different kinds of magical catalysts are also given (showing just how much magic there is in an “eye of newt”). The Spell Casting Static Maneuver modifications table is expanded to include a few new categories of modifiers (as well as deal with each school of magic).</p>
<h4><a href="5702.html">SHADES OF DARKNESS</a></h4>
<p><strong>Shades of Darkness</strong> is a genre book that explores the post-apocalyptic Earth when magic has returned. The setting is basically fantasy, but with a familiar feel. The United States is now run by dark overlords who have saved the human race from extinction, but at a price that some feel is too high to pay.</p>
<h4><a href="5604.html"><span id="channeling">CHANNELING</span> COMPANION</h4>
<p>Though this book will not actually be released in 1997, it is close enough to completion that we felt the appropriate contents should be presented in this book. There are four new professions presented in the <em>Channeling Companion</em>: the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Summoner">Summoner</a> (an <span id="essence">Essence</span>/<span id="channeling">Channeling</span> hybrid user), the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warlock">Warlock</a> (a <span id="mentalism">Mentalism</span>/<span id="channeling">Channeling</span> hybrid user), the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Mythic">Mythic</a> (a <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> semi-spell user), and the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest</a> (a pure <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> user). There are training packages, rules for dealing with spirits, rules for divine intervention, and guidelines on divine status.<br />
The most important aspect of the <em>Channeling Companion</em> is the system for Priest creation. Though there is a new profession for Priests, each <em>GM</em> must customize the priests that he will use in his world (using the rules presented in this book).</p>
<h3>ERRATA AND CLARIFICATIONS</h3>
<p>Over the year of 1997, several clarifications were made to the rules presented in previously published books. A summary of the major errata and clarifications is presented below.</p>
<ul>
<li>When using <em><a href="5520.html">Arms Law</a></em> weapons against modern/pulp body armors, treat Body Armor Type I at AT 5, Body Armor Type II as AT 6, Body Armor Type III as AT 7, and Body Armor Type IV as AT 8. In all cases, change all Puncture criticals to Krush criticals (other types of criticals remain unaffected).</li>
<li>With the Nomenist caster, to determine the number of ranks of Primal Tongue that he knows, you must divide the sum of all his languages by 10 (the divisor was left off of the formula in <em><a href="5603.html">Essence Companion</a></em>). Also, the language tracking sheet mentioned in the text is not presented at all (it was cut due to space constraints in the book).</li>
<li>The range of Identify Vessel spell (on the Ocean Law spell list) should be 10 yds/level.</li>
<li>The eight level spell on the Magic Staff spell list should be titled Attune Staff. Also, the description for Greater Recall Staff was left out. It should read “As Recall Staff, except for range.”</li>
<h3>SPECIAL THANKS</h3>
<p>I wanted to take this opportunity to give a special thanks to those folks on the Rolemaster Internet Mailing List who have been constructive in their comments about the <em>RMSS</em> and who have continued to put up with my sarcastic and humorous remarks.</p>
