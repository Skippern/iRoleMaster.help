<h1><a name="RMSR_A-1"></a><a name="RMSR_A-1.0">A-1.0</a> The Skills</h1>
<p>This section details all of the skill categories and skills referenced within the <em>Rolemaster Standard Rules</em>. Each skill
category and associated skill definitions are grouped together on the front and back of a single page, with the skill category information
and Static Maneuver Table (SMT) on the front and the skill definitions on the reverse. An optional stat for each skill is provided at the end
of each skill description (see <a href="#RMSR_A-9.2">Appendix A-9.2</a>).<br />
General modifiers common to all skills within the category may be found near the bottom of the SMT, while modifiers specific to each skill
may be found with the definition of that skill. On many pages there is room left beneath the SMT for the GM to write down his own
general modifiers.<br />
Occasions will arise where the SMT for a skill category may not produce appropriate results for a particular application of a skill. In this
circumstance, the GM should modify the results to his liking, or use the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#RMSR_T-4.8.1">General Static Maneuver
Table T-4.8.1</a> (or <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#RMSR_T-4.3">T-4.3</a>).</p>
<h4><a name="RMSR_A-1.0.0.1">A-1.0.0.1</a> KEY TO THE STATIC MANEUVER TABLES</h4>
<p>All rolls are open-ended high and low.
If the initial <strong>unmodified</strong> roll is 66 or 100, the special optional entries for those values may be used instead of the
modified result (the GM should examine these results carefully to appraise their suitability to his game; they have been highlighted to
facilitate their exclusion if necessary).<br />
Note that any modifier specified in the text of a result is <strong>not</strong> cumulative (i.e., an individual can only have one such
modifier in effect at a given time for a particular skill).<br />
Each result has a code associated with it: ##%&nbsp;•&nbsp;#.#※&nbsp;•&nbsp;##➠<br />
## % — This indicates the extent to which a maneuver was successful. If partial or extra success is inappropriate, the GM should simply
take 100% or higher as success and anything lower as failure.<br />
## ※ — This indicates a multiplier to the amount of time the task would ordinarily take to accomplish. The GM should determine how
long a "standard" successful maneuver would take, and may, at his discretion, apply this multiplier to that time to determine the speed
with which a character accomplished a task.<br />
## ➠ — This gives a modifier to a subsequent related action on the part of a character. Note that this modifier may only be applied to an
activity that is both immediate and integrally related to the maneuver that yielded this result. For example, a mage makes a static
maneuver using his Research skill to study the teachings of a famous mathemetician, and receives a Subsequent Action modifier of +30.
He then makes an Advanced Math static maneuver to utilize those teachings to solve a complex problem. He may add the +30 modifier to
his Advanced Math static maneuver roll. This modifier is cumulative with any modifier specified in the text of the result.</p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> The GM may determine that this modifier is innapropriate to a particular subsequent action, whereupon it
should be ignored.

<h3><a name="RMSR_A-1.1.1">A-1.1.1</a> ARMOR&nbsp;•&nbsp;Light/Medium/Heavy Skill Descriptions</h3>
<p>Each Armor Type has a Moving Maneuver Penalty (MMP) associated with it for untrained individuals (refer to <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#RMSR_T-3.3">Armor Table T-3.3</a>). This penalty modifies Moving Maneuver rolls. The different armor types are divided into five groups based upon the composition of the armor: types 1-4 = No armor; types 5-8 = Soft Leather; types 9-12 = Rigid Leather; types 13-16 = Chain; and types 17-20 = Plate. There are no Moving Maneuver Penalties associated with No Armor, and therefore there is no need to apply skill ranks towards it.<br />
The Soft and Rigid Leather skills are both found in the Light Armor Skill Category; Chain is found in the Medium Armor Skill Category; Plate is found in the Heavy Armor Skill Category.<br />
Every encumbering armor has a minimum maneuver penalty associated with it. The skill bonus for maneuvering for a group of armor types reduces the maximum penalty for maneuvering until the minimum maneuver penalty is reached. This limit represents the fact that the weight and constriction of the armor will always hinder the character to some extent. These minimums may vary for certain superior or magical armor.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Dral has 20 category and skill ranks in Maneuvering in Plate Armor. He may wear breastplate and greaves (AT 18) with a MMP of only 30 = 110 - ((10 x 5) + (10 x 3)). If he wears just the breastplate (AT 17), the MMP is 15 even though 90 ((10x5)+(10x3))=10; since 15 is the minimum maneuver penalty associated with wearing a breastplate.
</blockquote>
<p>Notes on the Advantages of Armor Types: Armor types are designed to reflect the protective capability on one’s covering. Heavier coverings(e.g., ATs 15, 16, 19, 20, etc.) are usually much more cumbersome than light armor or mere clothing. It is easier to make contact with combatants in heavy armor in combat, but it resists penetration better than the less cumbersome armor types. Therefore, “critical strikes” achieved against the more cumbersome armor types will be less frequent and lower in severity. However attacks resulting in just concussion hits will be more frequent (i.e., the hindrance due to these coverings make the target easier to strike but harder to seriously damage).<br />
Less cumbersome armor types have the advantage of providing the wearer with mobility. Fewer swings will make contact because the agile defender will completely avoid the blows. However, when a swing does make contact, the result is usually more severe than it would be against the more cumbersome armor types: frequent and severe criticals along with more concussion hits are the rule.<br />
Animals often attack the upper body. In addition, their penetrating power is usually limited. This is reflected in the Arms Law animal attack tables. Animals and monsters can be devastating against the lighter armor types where the wearer’s high mobility is outweighed by the creature’s superior maneuverability. However, against higher armor types, most beast attacks are relatively ineffective.<br />
Spell attacks are also affected by armor. Metal armor is particularly effective when a character is resisting spells, but often lessens the wearer’s mobility. Therefore, he may be easier to hit with most Elemental spells but harder to severely damage. Lightning, and other forms of electrical attacks, are more effective against metal clad foes. Fire is more effective against flammable armor types; primarily the organic armor types (e.g., leather and cloth).<br />
In addition, each armor type has a Quickness penalty associated with it. This penalty is applied against the bonus one’s Quickness stat bonus gives to the Defensive Bonus. Note that this penalty cannot bring one’s Quickness stat bonus below zero (0) for the purposes of one’s DB; any result below zero remains zero. {Light: Ag; Medium: St; Heavy: St}</p>

<a name="Power-throwing"></a><h5>Power-throwing</h5>
<p>This skill allows the use of a controlled burst of strength to increase the range of a thrown object, such as a javelin, hammer, stone, etc. The use of this skill requires a 40% activity action the round before the “throw” takes place. The round of the strike, the character receives a bonus to his weapon range according to how much force he placed into the throw, which in turn affects the difficulty of the maneuver.{St}</p>
<a name="Weight-lifting"></a><h5>Weight-lifting</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus to attempts to lift heavy weights or objects. While it is possible to lift these weights without the use of this skill, the techniques conferred by this skill allow greater weights to be lifted, and the likelihood of injury to be lessened. Note that this skill requires a great deal of practice and exercise to develop properly, and will increase the musculature of the individual. The use of this skill requires a round of preparation, during which only 10% activity may be performed and the individual’s DB is reduced to zero. {St}</p>

<p>This category includes those skills which involve the application of agility and coordination in a structured fashion, as opposed to a spontaneous or unstructured application (e.g., the frantic pinwheeling of arms one makes to maintain balance after an unexpected shove would not be an application of an Athletic&nbsp;•&nbsp;Gymnastic skill, but a considered effort to use one’s knowledge of balance and
one’s own flexibility and agility to successfully walk a narrow ledge would be).</p>

<a name="Acrobatics"></a><h5>Acrobatics</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for in-air maneuvers (e.g., flying or levitation) or swinging on objects. This skill includes the use of parallel bars, uneven bars, and other gymnastic activities in which the majority of the activity is spent in airborne maneuvers. A successful skill roll can reduce the severity of a falling critical by one (i.e., an 'B' becomes a 'A', a 'D' becomes a 'C', etc.). {Ag}</p>
<a name="Athletic_Games_(Gymnastic)"></a><h5>Athletic Games (Gymnastic)</h5>

<a name="Climbing"></a><h5>Climbing</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for climbing maneuvers over relatively short distances through the use of hand holds, etc. This could range from the ability to climb sheer faces (absurd) to climbing a ladder (easy). The normal climbing rate for walls with adequate hand holds is 10'/rnd as a “Medium” moving maneuver. Poorer handholds or greater speed will increase the difficulty of the maneuver. Note that extended climbs may require the use of the Athletic Endurance: <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Scaling">Scaling</a> Skill. {St}</p>
<a name="Contortions"></a><h5>Contortions</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for manipulating one’s body in order to move through small openings or absorb sudden crushing impact (other than falls). This skill also helps one escape from bonds, etc. {SD}</p>
<a name="Diving"></a><h5>Diving</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for controlled falling maneuvers. This can range from controlling the direction of an extended fall to diving into water safely from a great height (up to 20'/skill rank if a successful maneuver roll is made). {Ag}</p>
<a name="Flying/Gliding"></a><h5>Flying/Gliding</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for flying or gliding through the use of natural or artificial wings (e.g., feathered wings, parachute, hand-glider, balloonist, etc.). Flying/gliding has a natural -75 for all types of maneuvers performed while trying to fly/glide if this skill is
not learned or developed. Does not include powered aircraft of any type. {In}</p>
<a name="Juggling"></a><h5>Juggling</h5>

<p>This category includes those skills which involve the organized use of one’s ability to recognize and assimilate clues and information in the pursuit of some specific goal, in a structured fashion, as opposed to a spontaneous or unstructured application of such abilities (e.g., an attempt to orient oneself to a combat situation after taking a stunning blow would not be an application of an Awareness&nbsp;•&nbsp;Searching skill, but to trying to read the signs of a battle afterwards in order to perceive the course it had taken

<h3><a name="RMSR_A-1.8.1">A-1.8.1</a> AWARENESS&nbsp;•&nbsp;Searching Skill Descriptions</h3>
<a name="Detect_Traps"></a><h5>Detect Traps</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for detecting inanimate traps or ambushes. Note that this skill is <strong>not</strong> “automatic”; the individual must state that he is searching for signs of a trap or ambush for this skill to come into play. {In}</p>
<a name="Lie_Perception"></a><h5>Lie Perception</h5>

<a name="Observation"></a><h5>Observation</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for noticing details about the environment for assimilation and analysis. This is normally only usable in an active fashion, and requires concentration. Note that this skill is different from Alertness, which represents a general and unconscious level of receptivity and awareness of events and details within one's immediate environment. This skill reflects the active observation, noting and appraisal of such details. For example, if a character were about make camp in an unsafe location, the GM might make an Alertness static maneuver for that character to determine whether or not he notices the danger. If the character indicated that he wished to examine the location for suitability, the character would instead make an Observation static maneuver.{SD}</p>
<a name="Poison_Perception"></a><h5>Poison Perception</h5>

<a name="Reading_Tracks"></a><h5>Reading Tracks</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for gleaning information from a set of tracks or spoor. Detailed information about the tracks can be obtained, such as type of creatures, age of tracks, weight of creature, speed creature moving at, back tracking, etc. This skill is used for identifying the tracks and the skill Tracking (q.v.) is used for spotting and following the tracks. {SD}</p>

<a name="Reality_Awareness"></a><h5>Reality Awareness</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus to determine if the natural order or reality has or is going through turmoil, (e.g., Demonic Gate opening or closing, power fluctuation which is disturbing or causing the fabric of this dimension to shift, holes in the space-time continuum, residual powerful magic, etc.). Note that this skill may be severely limited in its availability. {Em}</p>
<a name="Sense_Awareness"></a><h5>Sense Awareness</h5>

<a name="Situational_Awareness"></a><h5>Situational Awareness</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus to the individual’s ability to notice and assimilate information from the environment in a specific type of situation. This is a combination of active and passive skills specifically trained for maximum effectiveness within a given situation. For example, Scouting Awareness is used by the point man in a squad of soldiers to be alert to possible enemy approaches, traps, Sleep Awareness might aid in sleeping lightly to prevent being taken unawares, etc. Urban Awareness might aid in staying alert for muggers, oncoming vehicles, etc. Skill with Situational Awareness must be developed for each situation, as determined by the GM. {In}</p>
<a name="Spatial_Location_Awareness"></a><h5>Spatial Location Awareness</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for allowing one to be aware of his surroundings without the aid of sight. Blindness accrues a -100 modification; Spatial Location Awareness (SLA) provides a bonus to offset that penalty (the adjusted modification may actually rise as high as +10 through the use of this skill). This skill is usually used by the blind. If a non-blinded individual possesses this skill, they must reorient to use this skill (requires minimum of one round). If the individual fails this roll, he is treated as blinded for that round. For each round the individual is left undisturbed or uses only 20% of hisactivity, hemay add +5 to the orientation roll each round. This +5 is cumulative (to a maximum of +50) provided there is no interruption of the individual’s concentration. This skill is blocked by intervening barriers. {Pr}</p>
<a name="Time_Sense"></a><h5>Time Sense</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for determining the time of day or how much time has passed over a specific period. This is a combination of the ability to estimate internally the passage of time, as well as using external references such as the sun, stars, etc. When no external referents are available (e.g., underground,in a jail cell, etc.), it is significantly more difficult to estimate the pasage of time. Also, after sleep or unconsciousness one typically requires the use of external referents to "reset" one's internal clock; the lack of same will hinder the use of this skill.<br />
This skill may be used to attempt to wake oneself from sleep at a predetermined time. {Em}</p>

<p>Skill rank in Body Development is one of the factors which determines how many hits (concussion hits) a character can take without passing out. A character’s total hits are equal to his Body Development skill bonus.</p>
<a name="Body_Development"></a><h3><a name="A-1.10.1">A-1.10.1</a> BODY DEVELOPMENT Skill Descriptions</h3>
<p>The number of hits a character can take is equal to his Body Development skill bonus. This skill enhances the character’s ability to resist damage, and withstand pain and shock. A character’s Body Development skill bonus determines how many hits (concussion hits) a character can take without passing out. Note that this is not merely strength training—training in this skill provides a greater tolerance for pain, physical toughness and discipline in the face of wounds and bleeding. An individual might remain a very slight and frail-looking individual but still hold a large number of ranks of body development. Whenever this skill is developed, consult the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#RMSR_T-1.1">Race Abilities Table T-1.1</a> and reference the character’s race against the column titled Body Development. These numbers show the skill bonus progression for the character’s race. {Co}</p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> All characters receive a special +10 bonus to this skill.
</blockquote>
<p>Each character has a maximum number of hits (also called concussion hits) equal to his skill bonus for Body Development. Normally, this skill bonus consists of the following:<br />
<em>Body Development skill bonus</em> = <strong>Total Hits</strong><br />
= 10 + (2 x Co stat bonus) + SD stat bonus<br />
+ profession bonus + skill rank bonus + any special bonuses<br />
A character takes hits as damage from attacks—hits reflect pain, shock, and bleeding. When the hits that a character has taken is greater than or equal to his maximum hits, he passes out. When the hits that a character has taken is greater than or equal to his maximum hits plus his Constitution, he dies.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Exhaustion:</strong> A character receives a penalty to his attacks and maneuvers based upon what percentage of his hits he has taken:</p>
<p><strong>Healing Hits:</strong> Once a character has taken hits, they may be “healed” in the following four ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><p> If a character is active, one hit is recovered every three hours.</p></li>
<li><p> If a character is resting, (Co stat bonus ÷ 2) hits are healed every full continuous hour of rest (at least one hit is recovered, even if the Co stat bonus is less than one).</p></li>
<li><p> If a character is sleeping, (Co stat bonus x 2) hits are healed for every three hours of continuous sleep. If this sleep is interrupted, hits are still healed as in 2) above.</p></li>
<li><p> In addition, hits may be healed by outside methods (see <a href="5500.html#RMSR_32.2">Section 32.2</a>); e.g., spells,
herbs, etc.</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Hoodaw the Half-elven Bard has decided that he’s tired of his own sniveling everytime he drops his staff on his foot. He began with 17 concussion hits [(10 (for the special bonus) + 7 (for the rank he receives during adolescence) + 5 (for the profession bonus he receives as a Bard) -6 (for twice his Constitution stat bonus of -3) + 1 (for his Self-Discipline stat bonus of +1) = 17]. He buys two more ranks in Body Development, and consults the Race Abilities Table. His progression (for Half-elves) is 0&nbsp;•&nbsp;7&nbsp;•&nbsp;5&nbsp;•&nbsp;3&nbsp;•&nbsp;1. As this is his second and third rank of Body Development (the rank during adolescence counts, remember), he is delighted to discover that he now gets to add 14 points to his Body Development total. He struts away, sneering at danger.

<em>Classification:</em> Static Maneuver, Special, and OB
<p>This category deals with the use of specialized maneuvers used in combat to achieve specific results. This may include fighting styles, special strokes, or defensive maneuvers used in conjunction with a particular mode of combat. Note that these skills serve as limits and modifications to combat abilities and are not attacks in and of themselves.</p>
<h3><a name="A-1.11.1">A-1.11.1</a> COMBAT MANEUVERS Skill Descriptions</h3>
<a name="Adrenal_Deflecting"></a><h5>Adrenal Deflecting</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for using the body (hands, etc.) or a weapon or a shield to deflect or even catch a thrown weapon or missile directed at the user (this is treated as an action requiring at least 50% activity; with a -1 modification for each 1% activity less than 50%). To determine the effect of such an attempt roll (open-ended) add the Adrenal Deflection skill bonus. Then refer to the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#RMSR_T-4.1">Maneuver/Movement Table, T-4.1</a>, using the “Extremely Hard” column against thrown weapons and the “Sheer Folly” column against missile weapons. If the result is a number, it is subtracted from the weapon’s attack roll (in addition to the normal DB). If the missile or thrown object misses, the character has a chance of catching the item. Roll d100 (open-ended) and add the modification received earlier from the Movement Maneuver Table; if the result is over 100, the item has been caught, if desired. {SD}</p>
<a name="Mounted_Combat"></a><h5>Mounted Combat</h5>
<p>This skill limits one’s OB against an opponent while mounted. The OB of an attack made while mounted can not exceed the attacker’s Mounted Combat skill bonus. A character's Mounted Combat skill cannot have more skill ranks developed than his Riding skill ranks. {Em}</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Kohrist the Surly prefers to use a battleaxe while horsed, and wields it with a formidable +98 OB. He is only an adequate rider, however, having 6 ranks in Riding. He is limited to 6 ranks, therefore, in Mounted Combat. After stat bonuses and other modifications, his Mounted Combat skill bonus is +37. He will therefore only be able to wield his battleaxe from horseback with an OB of +37. If he wishes to increase his Mounted Combat skill, he is going to have to increase his skill at Riding as well.
</blockquote>
<a name="Quickdraw"></a><h5>Quickdraw</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for getting a weapon from scabbard into battle very quickly. If successful, the weapon is out of the scabbard and in hand and moreover may make an attack and/or move the same round without the normal 20% activity required (-20 penalty) for drawing a weapon. If the skill check fails, he has dropped the weapon. On a partial success, the character takes the normal time (and penalty) to draw the weapon. {SD}</p>
<a name="Reverse_Stroke"></a><h5>Reverse Stroke</h5>
<p>This skill provides a limit for applying one’s melee OB against an opponent to one’s flank or rear without turning or changing position. The OB of an attack made in this fashion can <strong>not</strong> exceed the attacker’s Reverse Stroke skill bonus. Note that this skill must be developed separately for each weapon category. {Pr}</p>
<a name="Subdual"></a><h5>Subdual</h5>
<p>This skill allows an individual to immobilize or render unconscious a target by applying a sharp blow to a precise point on the victim’s upper body. The foe is assumed to be “of kind” (usually humanoid) and not “Large” or “Super-large.” The OB of a subduing attack can <strong>not</strong> exceed the attacker’s Subdual skill bonus (e.g., a Fighter with an OB of +120 and a Subdual bonus of +70 would only be able to apply a +70 OB to his attack). Instead of rolling criticals on the Critical Table indicated by the Weapon Attack Table, the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#AL_T-4.9">AL Subduing Critical Table 4.9</a> should be used. {SD}</p>
<a name="Swashbuckling"></a><h5>Swashbuckling</h5>
<p>This skill allows an individual to perform elaborate maneuvers with his weapon, including flourishes and feats of weapon control. This skill may, at the GM’s discretion, be used to recover control of a fumbled weapon (only possible if a fumble result has indicated that the wielder has “lost control” of a weapon, not “dropped” it), and may be used to perform unusual maneuvers with one’s weapon. Note that fumbles resulting froms washbuckling attempts may not be negated by further use of this skill. {Pr}</p>
<a name="Tumbling_Evasion"></a><h5>Tumbling Evasion</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for evading a attack by using a tumbling maneuver. The skill rank (<strong>not</strong> the skill rank bonus) is added to the DB. This skill is rolled for during the round that the skill is actively used. Individual may not parry, use a shield, or attack while using this skill. {Ag}</p>
<a name="Two-Weapon_Fighting"></a><h5>Two-Weapon Fighting</h5>
<p>This skill allows a combatant to fight with two weapons simultaneously. He is allowed to make 2 weapon attacks for each melee attack action, and may engage two opponents providing neither opponent is receiving any positional combat modifiers for their OB (e.g., If either opponent is receiving +15 for Flank Attack or +20 for Rear Attack the individual cannot attack both opponents in the same round).<br />
Two Weapon Fighting skill must be developed for <strong>each</strong> individual two-weapon combination (e.g., shortsword handaxe, rapier/dagger, etc.). A character's skill rank with a two-weapon combination may not exceed his skill rank of <strong>either</strong> of the individual weapons (e.g., if a Fighter has 5 skill ranks with a dagger and 9 skill ranks with a short sword, he may only have 5 skill ranks with his short sword/dagger two-weapon combination). The OB for each weapon attack is equal to the skill bonus for the Two Weapon Fighting skill for the combination of those two weapons.<br />
<strong>Against 1 Opponent:</strong> There is no negative attack modification against one opponent.<br />
<strong>Against 2 Opponents:</strong> There is -20 modification to both attacks. <br />
<strong>Parrying:</strong> The user must reduce <strong>both</strong> weapon OBs by the same amount (i.e., the amount of his parry). Against one opponent, the user increases his DB by the amount of his parry. Against two opponents, the amount of his parry must be split between the two opponents as the user sees fit.<br />
<strong>Using the off-hand:</strong> Each weapon combination is considered to have been developed for each specific weapon in a specific hand. For example, a Rogue trained in a rapier/dagger combination might have decided to use the rapier left-handed and the dagger in his right. Switching either weapon to the other hand incurs the normal -20 penalty for use with the off-hand. {SD}</p>

Each language must be developed individually, with the written and spoken versions of a language each counting separately. Skills in one language normally have little effect on others; however, “brother languages,” those deriving from an immediate common ancestor, may be an exception.<br />
One’s skill <strong>rank</strong> indicates the level of comprehension of a spoken or written language. See the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#RMSR_T-4.7">Language Rank Table T-4.7</a>.<br />
One’s skill bonus with a written form of a language serves as a skill bonus to writing attempts using that language. The spoken skill bonus for a language is used to improve communication with someone. A successful static maneuver means that the spoken language rank of the person with whom you are communicating is temporarily increased for the purposes of this conversation, to a maximum of
the rank developed by the individual performing the static maneuver. {Em}</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Beeborukamuk has 7 ranks and a bonus of +42 (through various bonuses) in the language of Jeepha. He is trying to communicate with Mook, who has only 3 ranks in it. He makes a static maneuver to attempt to communicate effectively with Mook at rank 7 (a -40 modification to the maneuver), and succeeds. Mook’s rank in Jeepha is considered to be at rank 7 for the purposes
of this single conversation. Note that there is no possibility that a maneuver could have raised Mook’s effective rank to 8, as Beeborukamuk doesn’t even speak that well.
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Racial Languages:</strong> These are the languages generally used and recognized by the individual races.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Elvish and Dwarvish.
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Cultural Languages:</strong> These are the language variations in an area, usually related to some extent to the racial language(s).</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> The sibilant tongue of the North Vestallans, or the guttural speech of the Gettians.
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Social Languages:</strong> These are the language variations in a particular culture.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> High Erian is used by the nobility in Eria, Common Erian is spoken by most others, while Street Talk is used by the lower classes. It is up to the individual GM to determine whether any such variants exist and what their similarity to each other is (e.g., knowing Erian High Speech allows half skill rank in Common Erian and 1/4 skill rank in Street Talk).
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Professional Languages:</strong> These Languages are the special Languages spoken by a particular profession, and need not be related to any spoken language.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Sword Tongue is spoken by the members of the Brotherhood of the Blade and is a special manufactured language used for recognition and secrecy by the higher echelons. Old Landalian is spoken by the members of the Elcaluva College (spell users) for the same reasons plus the fact that it is the now dead language that many of the ancient Magi used (and wrote their texts in). The Thieves’ Guild uses a hyper-slang language known as Thieves’ Chant, for recognition, secrecy, and safety.
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Religious Languages:</strong> These Languages are the special Languages spoken by the various religious orders, for reasons of tradition, ceremony, and recognition. They may or may not be related to any other spoken language.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> The Priests of Kanorak speak Kanorakki in High Ceremony and for recognition (a god-given language for the followers of the True Faith), and Old Nakrin, an ancient form of the current language which can be spoken by laymembers at 1/2 skill rank. Druid Tongue, however, has been preserved unchanged untold Eons and while spoken by the Inner Circle of Druids, is now too far removed from current Languages to be considered related.
</blockquote>
<a name="Lip_Reading"></a><h5>Lip Reading</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for reading lips and sign language. Lip reading is only possible with languages that the lip reader knows and then only to the known spoken skill rank. Special creatures (e.g., the Chicken People) might cause a penalty to be added to the character’s bonus due to distinct lack of lips. Line of sight must be maintained with the subject’s mouth. Skill is halved for reading the lips of creatures not of the same general type. Types: Human, Reptile, Avian, Non-Human Mammalian, etc. {SD}</p>
<a name="Magical_Languages"></a><h5>Magical Languages</h5>
<p>This skill enables characters to learn magical languages. These languages are acquired in the same fashion as are regular languages. These Languages are rarely spoken except in conjunction with spell casting, where they aid the spell’s potency. This is the language of Power Words. The effects of such languages will be covered in an upcoming RM supplement.{SD}</p>
<a name="Signaling"></a><h5>Signaling</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus when using any form of signal communications. This skill is a specialized form of linguistics and linguistics guidelines apply. {Me}</p>

<p>The skills in this category provide bonuses to directed spell attacks utilizing the elemental form to which they apply. For example, skill in fire directed spells will give a bonus to all <em>Fire Bolts</em> (regardless of range). Skill may be developed separately for each such spell. A character wishing to develop skill with such a spell must be able to cast it without the need of a spell roll at least once a day, either intrinsically or from an item or runes (i.e., it cannot require overcasting, etc.).<br />
The five types of directed spells (with their associated Attack Table) are Fire Bolts (<a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.4">SL 5.4</a>), Ice Bolts (<a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.5">SL 5.5</a>), Lightning Bolts (<a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.6">SL 5.6</a>), Shock Bolts (<a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.7">SL 5.7</a>) and Water Bolts (<a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.8">SL 5.8</a>).

<h3><a name="RMSR_A-1.15.1">A-1.15.1</a> INFLUENCE Skill Descriptions</h3>
<a name="Bribery"></a><h5>Bribery</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for offering a bribe to an individual in the proper and unobtrusive manner. At the GM’s discretion, this may also allow the identification of bribeable individuals; the GM may also allow the use of this skill to help in identifying persons likely to
have been bribed by the evidence of some unusual behavior. {In}</p>
<a name="Diplomacy"></a><h5>Diplomacy</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for operating successfully in a complex, bureaucratic foreign environment, such as a foreign royal court or any other large foreign government structure. Tact, negotiation, and deceit are all facets of diplomacy. It is used for the conducting of relations between nations. It is important to note that this skill provides a bonus for using the proper protocol in an unfamiliar situation and impressing a person in authority. This applies to situations ranging from an audience with the High King to an involuntary meeting with the Prince of Thieves. For operating within a familiar government system, refer to Administration. {In}</p>
<a name="Duping"></a><h5>Duping</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for speaking quickly, convincingly, and confusingly in order to get a victim to do something they would not ordinarily do. This skill usually may be used on only one person at a time. {In}</p>
<a name="Interrogation"></a><h5>Interrogation</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for extracting information from an intelligent source. This may or may not include causing discomfort to the target. However, if a target is discomforted and the “interrogation roll” fails, the target may suffer a major injury or death. In such a case, the target should roll an RR vs. level 10, using Co/SD/Co as a modifier to determine the extent of the injury. This skill not only applies to torture but also includes the ability to piece together scattered fragments of information received. {SD}</p>
<a name="Leadership"></a><h5>Leadership</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus to inspire and command others to follow you, and to make others believe that you are competent to lead and that you know what you are doing. This includes the ability to raise the morale of those you command. {Pr}</p>
<a name="Propaganda"></a><h5>Propaganda</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for influencing others through indirect means, rather than direct speech. Includes such ideas as starting rumors, as well as designing large advertising campaigns. {Re}</p>
<a name="Public_Speaking"></a><h5>Public Speaking</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for impressing, entertaining, or manipulating groups of people directly. Note that this is different from the Tale Telling skill, which is used on small groups, using stories and fables for entertainment and instruction. Public Speaking is for larger groups, is often more extemporaneous, and is used to manipulate the emotions or views of a crowd. {In}</p>
<a name="Seduction"></a><h5>Seduction</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus when attempting to emotionally, sensually, or sexually manipulate someone. Note that this is not limited to sexual seduction! Manipulation of a persons sensual sensibilities, urging a person to indulge in some fantasy or desire, and convincing a person of some tenet on emotional rather than rational grounds can all be classified as seduction. {In}</p>
<a name="Trading"></a><h5>Trading</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for transactions involving a bargained exchange of money or goods, particularly with respect to rolls on the purchase and resale price charts found in <em>Gamemaster Law</em>. {SD}</p>

One may develop this skill in general World History (subject to the available learning materials—i.e., if knowledge about the other side of the world is not available, it may not be learned) although the information will be far less specific, focusing instead on the broad strokes of history. If this skill is developed in the history of a particular region or subject, the information will be far more specific. In essence, the smaller the focus of the skill, the greater the level of detail and accuracy. Developing skill in the history of the Kingdom of Harran, for instance, might provide information about the rulers and the great events in the Kingdom's past; skill in the history of the Guild of Architects in the city of Jeppod would likely include all of the names of the Guild’s officers, the bylaws memorized by heart, etc. This skill encompasses military history as well. {Me}</p>

<h3><a name="RMSR_A-1.18.1">A-1.18.1</a> OUTDOOR • Animal Skill Descriptions</h3>
<a name="Animal_Handling"></a><h5>Animal Handling</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for the care and feeding of animals including bedding, hobbling, etc. This skill must be developed separately for each different type of animal. This skill is normally used in the handling of one animal at a time. {Em}</p>
<a name="Animal_Healing"></a><h5>Animal Healing</h5>

This skill must be developed separately for each different type of animal. {Em}</p>
<a name="Animal_Mastery"></a><h5>Animal Mastery</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for simple communicating and if possible, the mastering of an animal. This skill must be developed separately for each different type of animal. The animals that are controlled by use of this skill do not have to be trained or tame. The animal will only do what is within its capabilities.

<a name="Herding"></a><h5>Herding</h5>

<a name="Riding"></a><h5>Riding</h5>
<p>A single skill rank is necessary to keep from constantly falling off the animal being ridden. Higher skill ranks enhance the chance of controlling of the animal, or gaining control of an unfamiliar animal (of the type you have skill with). This skill must be developed separately for each different type of animal. See <a href="5500.html#RMSR_18.2.8">Section 18.2.8</a> for more information on Riding. {Em}</p>

<h3><a name="RMSR_A-1.20.1">A-1.20.1</a> POWER Awareness Skill Descriptions</h3>
<a name="Attunement"></a><h5>Attunement</h5>
<p>This skill enables a character to use the spell abilities of a staff, wand, or any item with spell casting abilities. In order to cast spells from an item, the wielder of the item must have made an Attunement static maneuver.<br />
If an item has several spells or groups of spells that are widely separated in power or type, the GM may require separate Attunement (staves &amp; wands) static maneuvers for each spell or group of spells.<br />
“Teaching” someone else an item is not permitted because using an item is a personal experience between the individual and the item. Although you may tell someone what the item does and thus remove any penalty for not knowing the spell(s) in the item, you cannot aid them. Certain spells on items do not normally require Attunement rolls, subject to GM stipulation. They include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Spells that operate constantly:</strong> Boots of Silence, Cloaks of Invisibility, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Bonuses built into items:</strong> Bonuses on weapons, bonuses on armor, spell adders, spell multipliers, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Spells in intelligent items:</strong> Intelligent items can cast the spells that they contain when instructed by a wielder who can communicate with the item and whom the item will obey (unless specifically created otherwise, intelligent items will obey any wielder).</li>
</ol>
<p>All of these cases include spells that do not require the conscious casting of any spell by the wielder of the item. A character should be given one chance to Attune to an item. If he fails, he may not try again until he improves his skill rank with Attunement. {Pr}</p>
<a name="Divination"></a><h5>Divination</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for the foretelling of the future or perceiving unknown quantities/qualities, with the use of divinatory means and methods (e.g., crystal balls, tarot cards, sticks, tea leaves, gleefully rooting around in the steaming entrails of freshly dead animals...ahem...sorry...dice, palms, etc.). Each method must be learned separately. Skill can also be used to scan the past and the present. {In}</p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> Divinations are general in nature and are left up to interpretation of symbology rather than the cleaner, clear cut means that the appropriate Divination spells give you. Also, Divination methods take a minimum of 1 minute (and often considerably longer) to perform.
</blockquote>
<a name="Power_Perception"></a><h5>Power Perception</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for seeing active Essence (blue), Channeling (red) and Mentalism (green) magic. If the GM allows players to develop the skill of Power Perception he should stipulate that Detect Magic spells will detect Magic, active or inactive (e.g., waiting spells). {Pr}</p>
<a name="Read_Runes"></a><h5>Read Runes</h5>
<p>Rune skill enables a character to decipher and use Runes (spells inscribed in suitable media). If the level of the spell on the Rune is less than or equal to the level of the character attempting to use it to cast a spell, deciphering the Rune is sufficient to use it (subject to the normal chances of spell failure). If the Rune is a level above the character, or of a realm of magic other than his specialty, a second roll, similar to the first, must be made to successfully cast the spell from the Rune. Runes are generally not reusable, but the rune paper is.<br />
A character should be given one chance to decipher a Rune. If he fails, he may not try again until he improves his skill rank with Read Runes. {Me}</p>

<a name="Channeling"></a><h5>Channeling</h5>
<p>This is the skill of transmitting and receiving power between two willing individuals over any distance, provided that contact can be made. The transmitter of the power must be able to see the receiver or know his exact location (direction and distance, or a specific place). The receiver must know exactly when the spell is coming. For example, if a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Cleric">Cleric</a> was at a certain altar at a certain time (midnight of full moon) ready to receive a spell, then another spell user (or deity) could use <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> to send him a spell (if he knew where the altar was and the correct time). In some cases it will occur when a Cleric is on a vital mission and his god decides to aid him. Characters may Channel to each other.<br />
It is important to note that the spells a “<span id="channeling">Channeling</span>” spell user, (e.g., <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Cleric">Clerics</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Animist">Animist</a>, etc.) acquires normally through worship and the use of intrinsic power points (although the entire realm is termed “<span id="channeling">Channeling</span>”) are not subject to this rule. Similarly, the development of Channeling skill will not allow others to gain a “<span id="channeling">Channeling</span>” spell user’s intrinsic spell ability. This skill applies to extraordinary channeling.<br />
<strong>Transmitting Power Points:</strong> Normally <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> consists of transferring power points from one character to another. The sender expends the power points and multiples this number of power points by his channeling skill bonus expressed as a percentage—this is the number of PPs sent (e.g., a sender with a +50 Channeling skill bonus and expending 20 power points actually channels only 10 = 50% x 20). Treat channeling abilities of greater than 100 as 100.<br />
The receiving character multiplies the number of points sent by his Channeling skill bonus expressed as a percentage (treat 100+ as 100). This result is the number of points received. These points may be used by the receiving character to cast spells as he wishes, although any unused points will be lost when next he sleeps.<br />
Channeling between characters (including NPCs) may only take place if they are concentrating on the same realm of power. In other words a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Cleric">Cleric</a> can’t channel to a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Magician">Magician</a>. Gods are, of course, able to channel to whomever they please. Hybrids may channel to or be channeled to by the character’s concentration on either of the Hybrid’s realms (e.g., a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Mystic">Mystic</a> can channel in either <span id="essence">Essence</span> or <span id="mentalism">Mentalism</span>).<br />
<strong>Transmitting Spells:</strong> Spells may be channeled in rare cases. If the receiver is of the proper spell realm, the sender may cast spells through him. It is not necessary for the receiver to know how to cast the spell; he is not required to do any of the work. The spell is cast, and the power points expended by the sender. The power points are subject to the same modifications for Channeling skill rank bonuses as power points sent without a spell, and sufficient power points must be received to cast the spell. The spell may not be cast if it depends on the receiving character to provide any of the power points; nor may the spell be cast by one individual while the power points required to cast the spell are channeled by someone else.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Bak is of the Mentalist realm of Magic. He has skill rank 1 in Channeling (+5) and no further bonuses. A high level Mentalist, Moour, offers to channel through him, and Bak agrees. Moour must either see Bak, make mental contact with him, or know exactly where Bak is. Bak must also know the exact time that the spell is being sent. Moour, in a crucial situation, throws Shield (a 3rd level spell) and puts 60 spell points into the effort. He has a +100 Channeling skill bonus and all 60 points are sent, but Bak receives only 5% or 3 of them. This, however, is enough to power the spell and it takes effect. Had Moour possessed only a +90 Channeling skill bonus, he would have had to expend 67 points for the spell to take effect (90% x 67 = 60 points sent, with 5% x 60 = 3 points being received). Failure to provide even one of these 67 spell points would cause the spell to fail.
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Burnout Due to Channeling:</strong> Successful Channeling can be dangerous. Roll 1-100 and add the number of power points received (this die roll is open-ended). Subtract the skill rank in Channeling of the receiving character. If the result is over 100, a burnout has occurred.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Bak’s brother Geen is a Cleric, with 14 skill ranks in Channeling. In a crucial situation, he asks his god, Blag, for help and Blag responds (the GM rolls an incredible reaction for the deity) by throwing the spell Absolution Pure through the Cleric. This is a 20th level spell and the god sends 40 power points with the spell. All 40 are sent (Blag is a god) and Geen receives 58% of them (23). He now rolls D100 to determine if it affects him. He rolls a 48 (+23 for the power points received in the spell), -14 for his skill rank (the skill rank, not the bonus is subtracted). The total is 57 (48 + 23 = 71 -14 = 57) and Geen does not suffer burnout.
</blockquote>
<p>Suppose that Geen had rolled a 97 instead of a 48. Since 97 is over 95, under the “open-ended” rules, he must roll again and add the result. He rolls a 23 the second time for a total “roll” of 120 before modifications. Again +23-14, yielding a 129. Geen has suffered some form of burnout.<br />
If burnout occurs, roll twice on the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#RMSR_T-2.3">Stat Gain Table, T-2.3</a>, using the number of points the roll was above 100 as the “Difference” used to determine the column used. This is the number of points that are lost from the Memory stat (the temporary not the potential). This process is repeated for Reasoning. If this process reduces either stat to 0 or below, all experience and skills are lost. On the brighter side, the character can switch professions as he has lost all memory of his adolescence and apprenticeship (though it will take him many years to function as an adult again). {SD}</p>
<a name="Magic_Ritual"></a><h5>Magic Ritual</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for enhancing a spell effect or duplicating a spell effect outside of normal spell resolution parameters (e.g., no power point expenditure). GM’s are warned that this skill can be easily abused. GM’s should understand how Magic works in their world before implementing this skill. Magic Rituals are not for hack-and-slash campaigns. Think of Celtic witches’ incantations or Shamanistic dances and you have a good idea how this skill should work. (Other skills can complement this skill such as Herb Lore, Dancing, Demon/Devil Lore, Poetry and Singing to make chants, etc.). Be imaginative. Be careful. {SD}</p>
<a name="Spell_Mastery"></a><h5>Spell Mastery</h5>
<p>This skill allows user to modify spells within or beyond basic parameters. Each individual spell list requires separate skill development (as with Riding or Weapon skills). This skill might be used to change the orientation upon arrival of the target of a Teleport spell, or it might be used to allow a spell user to attempt to alter a Bolt spell into a Ball spell.<br />
The character should roll for a successful Spell Mastery using the Power Manipulation Static Action Table. The result may indicate success or failure, as well as provide a modifier to the Spell Casting Static Maneuver Roll. {Pr}</p>
<a name="Transcend_Armor"></a><h5>Transcend Armor</h5>
<p>The character’s total skill bonus in Transcend Armor is applied against any Spell Casting Static Maneuver penalties accrued from wearing armor, wearing a helmet, or carrying equipment (similar in fashion to the way that Armor skills apply against maneuver penalties) to a maximum of a +0 modifier. If the penalty is reduced to zero, the character must still make the maneuver roll.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> If a character is an Essence user and wearing AT 13, he has a penalty of -40 to his Spell Casting Static Maneuvers. He may apply his Transcend Armor skill to this penalty to reduce it to zero.

<p>Skill rank in Power Point Development is one of the factors which determines how many spells a character can cast within a given time period. A character’s power point total is equal to his Power Point Development skill bonus. Hybrid spell users should average their realm stats to determine the stat bonus for this skill.</p>
<h3><a name="RMSR_A-1.22.1">A-1.22.1</a> POWER POINT DEVELOPMENT Skill Descriptions</h3>
<a name="Power_Point_Development"></a><h5>Power Point Development</h5>
<p>A character’s total Power Point (<dfn>PP</dfn>) is equal to his Power Point Development skill bonus. This skill allows a spell user to increase the total number of power points he may hold at any given time. The skill bonus progression for this skill is found on the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#RMSR_T-1.1">Race Abilities Table T–1.1</a> (note that a Hybridspell user mst use the lesser of his two realm’s progressions) A Hybrid spell caster averages his Realm stat bonuses to obtain his stat bonus for this skill.</p>
<p>In order to cast a spell, a number of PPs equal to the spell’ s level must be used. Each character has a maximum number of Power Points (<dfn>PPs</dfn>) equal to his skill bonus for Power Point Development (see <a href="#RMSR_A-1.22">Appendix A-1.22</a>).
Normally, this skill bonus consists of the following:</p>
<em>PP Development skill bonus</em> = <strong>PP Total</strong><br />
= “realm” stat bonus + profession bonus<br />
+ skill rank bonus + any special bonuses<br />
<p><strong>Recovering PPs:</strong> Once a character’s PPs are used casting spells, they may be regained (up to the maximum) in the following three ways:</p>
<ol>
<li> If the character is active, one PP is recovered every three hours.</li>
<li> If the character is resting, (realm stat bonus ÷ 2) PPs are recovered every full continuous hour of rest (at least one PP is recovered, even if the realm stat bonus is less than one). For a Hybrid spell user average the realm stat bonuses for his two realms before dividing by two.</li>
<li> If the character is sleeping, half of the maximum PPs are recovered for every three hours of continuous sleep. If this sleep is interrupted, PPs are still recovered as in 2) above.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Darien is a 20th level Illusionist (an Essence spell user) so his realm stat is Empathy. He has a Power Point Development skill bonus of 88 and an Empathy stat bonus of 9. So, he recovers 1 PP every three hours while active, 5 PPs (9÷2) every continuous hour of rest, and 44 PPs (88÷2) for every 3 hours of continuous sleep.
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PP Exhaustion:</strong> A character receives a modification to his spell casting static maneuvers (see <a href="5500.html#RMSR_26.0">Section 26.0</a>) based upon what percentage of his Power Points he has used:</p>

<p>This category encompasses the use of skills involving the exercise of self-control and willpower, ranging from body control to advanced mental techniques.</p>
<h3><a name="RMSR_A-1.24.1">A-1.24.1</a> SELF CONTROL Skill Descriptions</h3>
<a name="Adrenal_Balance"></a><h5>Adrenal Balance</h5>
<p>This skill enhances the ability of the character to maintain his balance in one maneuver action (requiring balance). The skill rank bonus is added to any maneuver roll required for the action (even if it takes several rounds). This skill requires taking a 20% activity action in a “preparation round” immediately prior to the use of this skill. {Ag}</p>
<a name="Adrenal_Concentration"></a><h5>Adrenal Concentration</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for achieving a special +25 bonus on any activity attempted using concentration and the focusing of internal reserves. If the user makes a successful static maneuver, +25 is added to any such activity the next round. However, this static maneuver requires 75% of the user’s activity the round it is attempted. {Pr}</p>
<a name="Adrenal_Landing"></a><h5>Adrenal Landing</h5>
<p>With a successful static maneuver, a character may decrease the severity of a fall by his skill rank bonus times one foot. For example, if a character’s skill rank bonus was +60, a 100' fall would be treated as a 40' fall. The severity of a fall can never be reduced below that of a 1' fall (requiring a roll on the Fall/Crush Attack Table with a +1 modification). A 20% activity action is required the round after the fall (assuming he’s alive and conscious). This is the “recuperation” round. {Ag}</p>
<a name="Adrenal_Leaping"></a><h5>Adrenal Leaping</h5>
<p>This allows the character to automatically increase the distance he can successfully leap from either a standing or a running start. The <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#RMSR_T-4.1">M/M Table T–4.1</a> can be used, with the skill bonus being added. A 100% would indicate a normal leap and results above that a longer jump. This skill requires taking a 20% activity action in a “preparation round” immediately prior to the use of this skill. {St}</p>
<a name="Adrenal_Quickdraw"></a><h5>Adrenal Quickdraw</h5>
<p>Bonus for drawing your weapon with 0% activity. Success indicates you have your weapon ready and failure indicates you take the normal 20% activity action for drawing your weapon. This skill does count against the one adrenal move every other round limit. It must be developed separately for each type of weapon (1-handed edge, 1-handed crushing, 2-handed, thrown, etc.). {Ag}</p>
<a name="Adrenal_Speed"></a><h5>Adrenal Speed</h5>
<p>This allows a character to move at twice normal speed (as if Hasted) and thus increase his activity for one round (see <a href="5500.html#RMSR_18.2.6">Section 18.2.6</a>). This skill requires taking a 20% activity action in a “preparation round” immediately prior to the use of this skill. {Qu}</p>
<a name="Adrenal_Stabilization"></a><h5>Adrenal Stabilization</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for keeping oneself alive after being injured. This skill puts your body into a near death condition (coma) for 1 day/round before death. (Rounds before death is obtained from the description of the critical strike taken). Due to the slowing down of your body’s metabolic rate, you will appear to be dead to all but the closest of scrutiny (-75 from other’s perception).<br />
If you fail to make a successful static maneuver, you immediately go into a coma but you still die at the appointed time. You may be awakened from this state by one or more of the following: Within 1 hour of the preset time or an Awaken spell or vigorous physical disturbance lasting more than 3 minutes. If you receive a critical that kills instantly, this skill will have no effect.<br />
Certain types of damage may make it impossible to use this skill (e.g., massive brain damage, head being completely ripped off or destroyed, body dissolving in acid, heart being ripped out of chest, etc.). Note: This skill should only be available under unusual circumstances (e.g., Healers, exotic monastic order, fanatic assassin training, etc.) {SD}</p>
<a name="Adrenal_Strength"></a><h5>Adrenal Strength</h5>
<p>This skill gives a character a +10 modification on his OB and doubles the number of concussion hits that he delivers. This skill requires taking a 20% activity action in a “preparation round” immediately prior to the use of this skill. {St}</p>
<a name="Cleansing_Trance"></a><h5>Cleansing Trance</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for purification ritual to help remove outside energies and influences that linger on a object, item, person, etc. The use of this skill enables the user to rid himself of the touch of curses and hexes. Skill must be used within 5 minutes/rank of Cleansing skill in order to benefit the user at all. Otherwise the only way to be cleansed is from a spell or a person with a higher skill rank in cleansing. Physical prodding allows one to make a static maneuver to leave the trance, as does a painful strike (modify by +25). {SD}</p>
<a name="Control_Lycantrypy"></a><h5>Control Lycanthropy</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for controlling one’s lycanthropy. Note that this skill may only be developed by an individual already infected with an active form of lycanthropy. This skill may be used to prevent the onset of a lycanthropic change, to control one’s bestial nature during such a change, or to initiate a change at will. {SD}</p>
<a name="Death_Trance"></a><h5>Death Trance</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus to causing oneself instantaneous and painless death. {SD}</p>
<a name="Frenzy"></a><h5>Frenzy</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus to attempt to go into a state of singleminded, unpredictable rage which results in an additional +30 to melee OB, the ability to take twice normal concussion damage and the ability to deliver double melee concussion hit damage. While in frenzy, you have no DB other than the armor bonus, get no shield bonus, and cannot parry. The static maneuver (i.e., preparation) for frenzy takes one round. Once in a frenzied state, the berserker may make a static maneuver each round in order to resume one’s normal state. Once frenzied, the berserker will continue to fight until there is no one left standing except himself, at which time he receives a +30 modification to static maneuvers to end the frenzy. While frenzied, the berserker may attempt (with an Awareness roll at a -30 modification) to distinguish friend from foe. {SD}</p>
<a name="Healing_Trance"></a><h5>Healing Trance</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for increasing one’s healing rate. The individual using this skill goes into a coma. Healing rate is increased/ decreased by the amount the static maneuver roll is over 100 as a percentage times the racial healing rate (see <a href="5500.html#RMSR_32.2">Section 32.2</a>). Physical prodding allows one to make a static maneuver to leave the trance, as does a painful strike (modify by +25). {Em}</p>
<a name="Meditation"></a><h5>Meditation</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for an individual entering, leaving and exploiting a mental trance which the individual can use to help solve difficult problems, increase his chance to successfully cast a spell, aiding in Attunement rolls, etc. (subject to GM stipulation). Physical prodding allows one to make a static maneuver to leave the trance, as does a painful strike (modify by +25). {SD}</p>
<a name="Mnemonics"></a><h5>Mnemonics</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for recalling information through the use of memory aids, techniques and tricks. {Me}</p>
<a name="Sleep_Trance"></a><h5>Sleep Trance</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for decreasing the amount of time one needs to fully recover. The sleep time is increased/decreased by the amount of the static maneuver roll is over 100 as a percentage times racial sleep requirement. Physical prodding allows one to make a static maneuver to leave the trance, as does a painful strike (modify by +25). {SD}</p>
<a name="Stunned_Maneuvering"></a><h5>Stunned Maneuvering</h5>
<p>This skill enables an individual to throw off the effects of stunning blows. A successful static maneuver using this skill will remove one or more rounds of stun from yourself. Failure may result in greater disorientation than before the use of this skill. {Pr}</p>

<h3><a name="RMSR_A-1.25.1">A-1.25.1</a> SPECIAL ATTACKS Skill Descriptions</h3>
<a name="Brawling"></a><h5>Brawling</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus to combat in which there is no organized melee (tavern brawls, riots, etc.). Targets are chosen on the basis of proximity and blows are exchanged in an essentially random fashion. This skill allows one to better handle oneself in such situations.<br />
Sometimes a character will find himself in combat without a weapon. If it is a general melee situation (i.e., combatants are using weapons designed kill each other), such a character may make “Martial Arts” attacks (e.g., degree 1-4 strikes, degree 1-4 sweeps, boxing, wrestling, tackling, etc.), see <a href="#RMSR_A-1.17">A-1.17</a>. He may <strong>not</strong> use Brawling attacks in such a
situation.<br />
If such a combatant has a substantial object in his hands capable of blocking a weapon blow (e.g., a stool, a mattress, a log, a body), he may be given a shield bonus for the item. In such a case, a GM may even allow the combatant to make a “club” attack.<br />
In a similar manner, a combatant may “parry” with suitable terrain features (e.g., dodge around a tree, duck under a large branch, step behind a door). As always, the GM is the final judge as to the appropriateness of such “parrying” situations.<br />
In a brawl (i.e., a general fracas, the combatants are not using killing weapons; e.g., a barroom brawl), an unarmed character can make Brawling attacks or Martial Arts attacks as he chooses.<br />
If the character chooses to make Brawling attacks, the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#AL_T-3.3">Arms Law Attack Table 3.3</a> should be used with Brawling criticals. The benefit of such a choice is in the relative non-lethality of Brawling attacks. {St}</p>

<p>By using this skill, attacks with melee or missile weapons may be dodged or deflected (wholly or partially). The skill bonus of the Defender is added to his DB versus melee attacks. Against missile attacks the skill bonus is halved and added to the Defensive Bonus. To use Adrenal Defense, you must be aware of the fact that you are under attack. In addition, the character must not be wearing any armor and cannot have a shield or large object in his hands. See <a href="5500.html#RMSR_23.2.8">Section 23.2.8</a>. {—}</p>
<a name="Adrenal_Toughness"></a><h5>Adrenal Toughness</h5>
<p>By using this skill, the individual may toughen his body to withstand blows that would otherwise inflict damage. This skill requires taking a 20% activity action in the round immediately prior to the use of this skill (or during the snap action phase of the same round). Then, the character must make a static maneuver modified by this skill bonus. If successful, the individual may reduce the severity of any critical by one (i.e., an 'E' becomes a 'D', a 'B' becomes an 'A', etc.) during the next round (or remainder of the current round). In addition, any self-inflicted critical stemming from the individual striking a surface or object is nullified completely (e.g., no Krush critical would be sustained from attempting to break a brick with one’s hand, etc.). {—}</p>

<p>A character's skill rank for a spell list determines which spells on that list he may cast. In addition, if certain restrictions are not met, a character's skill bonus for a spell's list can affect the casting of that spell.<br />
A character “learns” spells by developing skill ranks for the spell list that the spell is on. A character “knows” all of the spells on a spell list that have a level less than or equal to his skill rank for that spell list. See <a href="5500.html#RMSR_8.1">Section 8.1</a> and <a href="#RMSR_A-2">Appendix A-2</a> for more information on spell lists.<br />
Normally, a character may cast any spell on a list that has a spell level that is less than or equal to his skill rank for that list (i.e., any spell he “knows”). A character must use Power Points to cast a spell (see <a href="5500.html#RMSR_8.2">Section 8.2</a>). See <a href="5500.html#RMSR_26.0">Section 26.0</a> for details on preparing and casting spells.<br />
<strong>Automatic Spell Casting:</strong> If a spell is cast automatically, no static maneuver is required. A spell may automatically be cast if the restrictions outlined in <a href="5500.html#RMSR_26.0">Section 26.0</a> are met. However, such a spell may still fail:
<ul>
<li> All attack spells fail on an unmodified attack roll of 01-02 (see <a href="5500.html#RMSR_23.6">Sections 23.6</a>-<a href="5500.html#RMSR_23.8">23.8</a>). A 1d100 roll should also be made for each non-attack spells, the spell fails only on an unmodified 01-02.</li>
<li> Attack spells can also fail on certain modified attack roll results (see <a href="5500.html#RMSR_23.6">Sections 23.6</a>-<a href="5500.html#RMSR_23.8">23.8</a>).</li>
</ul>
<strong>Spell Casting Static Maneuvers:</strong> If a caster can not automatically cast a spell, he must make a static maneuver roll in order to be able to cast the spell. If this maneuver is successful, the spell may be cast with the same normal failure chances outlined above.<br />
This open-ended static maneuver roll is modified by +50, the caster’s skill bonus for the spell’s list, and all other appropriate modifications from the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#RMSR_T-4.6">Spell Casting Modifications Table T-4.6</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="RMSR_A-1.18.1">A-1.28.1</a> SUBTERFUGE • Attack Skill Descriptions</h3>
<a name="Ambush"></a><h5>Ambush</h5>
<p>This skill is the ability to make a very precise attack. To use his Ambush skill a character must approach his foe undetected and be able to strike before the foe can react. At this point, the character must declare whether he is striking to kill or to subdue. An attack is then made normally, and an Ambush static maneuver is made (0% activity) and modified by position, target’s alertness and other factors
(e.g., position, lighting, etc.).<br />
If the Ambush static maneuver is successful, the character may modify his result on the resulting critical strike roll (using the normal Arms Law Critical Table if the intent was to kill, or the Subdual Critical Table if the intent was to subdue). This modification consists of being allowed to adjust the critical strike roll by any number up to the Ambush skill <strong>rank</strong> (not bonus) of the attacker. This adjustment may be either up or down. Note that to use this bonus, the attacker must first get a normal critical strike result on an attack table. If he does, however, this ability greatly increases the chance of a killing or incapacitating blow and tremendously increases the chance of a result that takes effect instantly.<br />
Since position is relatively unpredictable in a general melee situation, Ambush skill rank is halved if an ambushed foe is in a melee situation. (<strong>Note:</strong> You must still approach the foe undetected and strike before he can react.)<br />
If a “Large” or “Super-large” creature is ambushed, the ambushing character may not declare a strike to subdue <strong>and</strong> the Ambush skill rank is <em>added</em> to the critical roll. If the resulting modified roll is above 95, a second roll is made and added to the modified critical as in a normal open-ended roll. {In}</p>
<a name="Silent_Kill"></a><h5>Silent Kill</h5>
<p>This skill is used in conjunction with an Ambush static maneuver. A successful Ambush static maneuver followed by a successful static maneuver using this skill (0% activity) results in the target being unable to make a sound during the attack. Note that this skill also requires that the attacker approach the foe undetected and strike before he can react. If an instant kill or immobilization result is obtained on a critical chart, the target does not make any noise. {In}</p>

<h1><a name="RMSR_A-2"></a><a name="RMSR_A-2.0">A-2.0</a> The Spells and Spell Lists</h1>
<p>This section explains how to use <em><a href="5522.html">Spell Law</a></em> with <strong><em>Rolemaster</em></strong> and how to read and understand the spell lists presented in <em><a href="5522.html">Spell Law</a></em>.<br />
<em><a href="5522.html">Spell Law</a></em> provides a wide variety of options for the players. Spell users are allowed to know a large number of spells, but can only use a few before tiring and requiring rest. Real skill in play in emphasized, because the choice of a spell and its application to a given situation become the key points. To this end, <em><a href="5522.html">Spell Law</a></em> provides over 2,000 spells based upon three realms of power (<span id="channeling">Channeling</span>, <span id="essence">Essence</span>, and <span id="mentalism">Mentalism</span>) and fifteen spell-using professions.</p>
<h3><a name="RMSR_A-2.0.1">A-2.0.1</a> GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR SPELL LISTS</h3>
<p>The spells found in <em><a href="5522.html">Spell Law</a></em> are organized into lists that reflect the similarities and basic applications common to the individual domains. Higher level spells found on a given list will reflect the increased knowledge and efficiency that comes from the use and practice of lower level spells on the same list. This reflects the learning process that accompanies development within a consistent spell grouping.<br />
The spell lists are also grouped in units. These collections are based upon the spell users’ various backgrounds within the greater realms of power. A <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Lay_Healer">Lay Healer</a>’s background and living experiences often differ significantly from the past life associated with a “pure” <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Mentalist">Mentalist</a>. Thus, certain spell lists will be easier for the Mentalist to learn; correspondingly, others will seem simpler to the Lay Healer. Each profession will find that their education is colored by their own background.<br />
The spells are described in a standard manner, using a basic format that simplifies usage. Most spells are specific, while others are accorded great flexibility. The latter group’s spells have descriptions that are less concrete, providing the Gamemaster with a framework by which he can apply spell usages to variance in his world system or specific occurrences that demand certain flexibility.<br />
Certain simplifications and organizational devices have been used to increase playability. Nonetheless, consistence and flavor are emphasized. After all, the world of spells is a rich one indeed.</p>
<h3><a name="RMSR_A-2.0.2">A-2.0.2</a> CLASSIFICATIONS</h3>
<p>Spell lists are classified according to their realm of power and availability to certain professions.</p>
<p><strong>Base Lists</strong>—There are six base lists for each spell using profession (including Pure spell users, Semi spell users, and Hybrid spell users). These lists may only be learned easily by members of the appropriate profession (others may attempt to learn them at great expense). The spells on these lists represent professional specialties.</p>
<p><strong>Closed Spell Lists</strong>—Closed spell lists involve the deepest and most powerful concepts common to each realm of magic, requiring tremendous dedication and specialization to master (or learn at all). Only Pure and Hybrid spell users learn these spell lists easily.</p>
<p><strong>Open Spell Lists</strong>—Open spell lists involve the easiest concepts to master in each realm of power, although considerable dedication is required to learn their use.</p>
<p><strong>Evil Spell Lists</strong>—Evil spell lists represent corrupt magic that is learned only by those who have given in to the darker side of magic.</p>
<h3><a name="RMSR_A-2.0.3">A-2.0.3</a> WHAT’S IN SPELL LAW</h3>
<p>Within <em><a href="5522.html">Spell Law</a></em>, there are 186 spell lists divided into:
<ul>
<li> 15 sets of professional “base” lists.</li>
<li> 1 set of “evil” spell lists for each realm of power.</li>
<li> 1 set of “closed” spell lists for each realm of power. </li>
<li> 1 set of “open” spell lists for each realm of power.</li>
<li> 3 sets of “other” professional base lists (i.e., spell lists associated with non-standard professions).</li>
</ul></p>
<h3><a name="RMSR_A-2.0.4">A-2.0.4</a> THE SPELL DESCRIPTION KEY</h3>
<p>Several types of codes may follow the spell names in the listings: area of effect, duration, range, and type. In addition, some descriptions will explain that a particular spell has an RR Modification (shown with the notation [RR Mod: #]). This section presents a key to those codes.</p>
<h4><a name="RMSR_A-2.0.4.1">A-2.0.4.1</a> Special Spell Codes</h4>
<p><strong>[RR Mod #]</strong> — Any RRs against the effects of this spell are modified by #.</p>
<p><strong>*</strong> — Instantaneous; spell does not require preparation rounds.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> — Spell does not require power points.</p>
<p><strong>‡</strong> — Part of a set of spells that must be thrown in conjunction with other spells continuously to be effective (or fully effective).</p>
<h4><a name="RMSR_A-2.0.4.2">A-2.0.4.2</a> Spell Types</h4>
<p><strong>E</strong> — Elemental spell. These spells use the force of the spell to manipulate physical elements (heat, cold, wind, light, water, earth, sound, smell, taste, touch). These elements (and not the spell) are used to either create a phenomena that can affect the physical environment of the target (e.g., a “wall” spell) <strong>or</strong> the sense of the target (e.g., an “illusion” spell). Because the elements are real, no Resistance Rolls are normally allowed.</p>
<p><strong>BE</strong> — Ball Elemental spell. These are elemental spells that attack an area with one of the physical elements. Such attacks are resolved on either <em>Spell Law</em> <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.2">Attack Table 5.2</a> or <em>Spell Law</em> <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.3">Attack Table 5.3</a>.</p>
<p><strong>DE</strong> — Directed Elemental spell. These are elemental spells that directly attack a target with one of the physical elements. Such attacks are resolved on one of the “bolt” attack tables (<em>Spell Law</em> <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.4">Attack Tables 5.4</a> through <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.8">5.8</a>).</p>
<p><strong>F</strong> — Force spell. These spells involve the direct manipulation of matter, energy, the elements, or living beings through the use of a spell’s force. If the spell has a target capable of resisting, the caster make an attack roll on the <em>Spell Law</em> <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.1">Basic Spell Attack Table 5.1</a> to determine the RR modification for the target. Determine the type of armor the target is wearing and roll on the appropriate column of the table (using the Other column if nothing else applies). After determining the RR modification, the target makes an RR (on <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.10">Table 5.10</a> in <em>Spell Law</em>, using the target’s level and the attacker’s level as the indices).</p>
<p><strong>P</strong> — Passive spell. These spells usually only indirectly or passively affect a target. Thus, if an RR is allowed (GM’s discretion), its purpose is only to determine if the target is aware of the spell. Many detection spells are of this type.</p>
<p><strong>U</strong> — Utility spell. These spells only affect the caster, a willing target, or a target incapable of resistance. Thus, RRs are not usually necessary. A willing target who is capable of resisting may still be required to make an RR (GM’s discretion), but it is modified by -50 (i.e., he mostly likely will not resist successful). Most healing spells are of this type.</p>
<p><strong>I</strong> — Informational spell. These spells involve gathering information through means that do not require RRs.</p>
<h4><a name="RMSR_A-2.0.4.3">A-2.0.4.3</a> Spell Sub-Types</h4>
<p><strong>s</strong> — Subconscious spell. These spells are capable of being cast (or triggered) by the subconscious. The caster can always cast a spell of this type as a normal spell; and if he is unconscious (or is asleep or in a trance), a spell of this type can be cast by the subconscious as necessary (starting with the highest level spell needed). An ex-ception to this is the <em>Stun Relief</em> spell. This spell may (at the option of the caster) be cast by the subconscious while the caster is stunned.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong> — Mental Attack spell. These spells affect the target’s mind and are subject to mental defenses.</p>
<h4><a name="RMSR_A-2.0.4.4">A-2.0.4.4</a> Spell Areas of Effect</h4>
<p><strong><em>x</em> target(s)</strong> — The spell affects <em>x</em> number of targets.</p>
<p><strong><em>x</em> target(s)/lvl</strong> — The spell affects a number of targets equal to the caster’s level times <em>x</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em>distance</em> R</strong> — The spell affects all within a radius equal to <em>distance</em> in size.</p>
<p><strong><em>distance</em> R / lvl</strong> — The spell affects all within a radius equal to <em>distance</em> times the caster’s level in size.</p>
<p><strong><em>area</em></strong> — The spell affects all within a fixed <em>area</em> of effect. Sometimes area will be specified as a specific target (e.g., 1 herb, 1 limb, etc.).</p>
<p><strong><em>caster</em></strong> — The spell affects only the caster.</p>
<p><strong>“—”</strong> — The spell has no area of effect.</p>
<p><strong>varies</strong> — The exact size of the area of effect depends upon some other aspect of the spell.</p>
<h4><a name="RMSR_A-2.0.4.5">A-2.0.4.5</a> Spell Durations</h4>
<p><strong><em>time</em></strong> — The spell has a fixed duration equal to time.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> — Concentration is required. Concentration takes 50% of the caster’s normal activity. The caster cannot cast any other spells while concentrating.</p>
<p><strong><em>duration</em> (C)</strong> — Concentration is required, except the period of concentration cannot exceed the <em>duration</em> given. The caster can stop concentrating and the spell effect will stop. If the duration has not expired, the caster can concentrate again and the spell effect will resume.</p>
<p><strong>P</strong> — Permanent. The spell has a permanent effect (in the sense of creating a “permanent” physical or mental condition). The effects of permanent spells that manipulate matter <strong>and</strong> require concentration will disperse according to the normal physical laws once concentration is no longer applied (e.g., a frozen body of water will melt normally, a bowl of boiling
water will cool). A spell with a permanent duration may be affect by outside forces. For example, the spell may be dispelled, cured, <strong>or</strong> otherwise disturbed by enchantment, physical force, etc.</p>
<p><strong>varies</strong> —Variable.Theexactdurationdependsuponsome other aspect of the spell.</p>
<p><strong>“—”</strong> — No duration. The effects of this spell required no duration and are applied immediately.</p>
<p><strong><em>time</em> / level</strong> — The duration is the <em>time</em> multiplied by the level of the caster.</p>
<p><strong><em>time</em> / # fail</strong> — The duration is based upon the difference between the target’s modified RR and the minimum roll required to resist the spell (see <a href="5500.html#RMSR_23.6">Section 23.6</a>). The duration is equal to this difference divided by # and then multiplied by <em>time</em>.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> 1 rnd/10 fail would mean that if the RR is failed by 20, the spell would last for 2 rounds.
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="RMSR_A-2.0.4.6">A-2.0.4.6</a> Spell Ranges</h4>
<p><strong>self</strong> — The spell can only be cast upon the caster himself.</p>
<p><strong>touch</strong> — The caster must touch the target to create the effect.</p>
<p><strong><em>distance</em></strong> — The caster can be no further than <em>distance</em> to the desired area of effect.</p>
<p><strong><em>distance</em> / lvl</strong> — The distance to the area of effect can be no further than <em>distance</em>
times the caster’ s level.</p>
<p><strong>unlimited</strong> — There are no limitations placed upon the distance to the area of effect.</p>
<p><strong>varies</strong> — The distance to the area of effect depends upon some other aspect of the spell.</p>
<h4><a name="RMSR_A-2.0.4.7">A-2.0.4.7</a> WHAT’S ON A SPELL LIST</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong> Spell List Name</strong>—The name of the spell list appears in two places on the page; above the descriptions and above the listing.</li>
<li><strong> Spell List Number</strong>—Each spell list is given a unique identifier that combines its classification and a the equivalent of a section number from <em>Spell Law</em>.</li>
<li><strong> Listing</strong>—In one of the upper corners of the page is a listing of all the spells on the list, sorted by level. This listing also shows important spell parameters.</li>
<li><strong> Check Box</strong>—Beside each spell in the listing is a check box. Use this box to indicate the level two which your character currently knows spells on the list.</li>
<li><strong> Spell Level/Name</strong>—The level and name of each spell appears in two places on the page; in the listing and in the descriptions. In all cases, if the name of two spells are the same (except for perhaps a roman numeral), the spells should be treated as the same.</li>
<li><strong> Area of Effect</strong>—This is the area affected by the spell. If “varies” appears here, check the description for the exact area of effect.</li>
<li><strong> Duration</strong>—This is the duration that the spell will remain active. If “varies” appears here, check the description for the exact duration.</li>
<li><strong> Range</strong>—This is the range from the caster to the area of effect. If “varies” appears here, check the description for the exact range.</li>
<li><strong> Type</strong>—This is the type of spell. The type of spell will determine what kind of resistance roll the target of the spell will get (if any).</li>
<li><strong> Notes</strong>—If there are any global notes or special rules for spells in this list, they will be found here.</li>
<li><strong> Illustration</strong>—Almost every spell list has an illustration demonstrating some spell effect or situation around a spell effect.</li>
<li><strong> Tabbed Dividers</strong>—Every spell list is tabbed according to its realm of power(s) and/or according to the appropriate rules section. Note that hybrid lists will have two tabs (one for each realm).</li>
</ol>
<h4><a name="RMSR_A-2.0.4.8">A-2.0.4.8</a> THE SPELL LISTS</h4>
<p>This is a list of all the normal spell lists that can be found in <em><a href="5522.html">Spell Law</a></em>.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5500/A-3/The Cultures &amp; Races" -->
<h1><a name="RMSR_A-3"></a><a name="RMSR_A-3.0">A-3.0</a> The Cultures &amp; Races</h1>
<p>The following are general descriptions of the races and cultures presented in the <strong><em>RMSS</em></strong>—more
cultures and races are available in the <strong><em>Rolemaster</em></strong> sourcebook, <em>Cultures &amp; Races</em>.
Certain modifiers are included for a greater sense of realism, but GMs should feel free to omit them if they consider them to be unwieldy. The information is intended to serve as a guideline for equipping and developing both player characters and powerful or otherwise significant non-player characters. The outfitting options and the background options have been generated to enhance the process by
which living peoples are translated into a game system.<br />
An individual character may stray from the norms of his culture/race. A GM may decide to allow a character to possess a weapon typically not favored by his culture/race, to learn a language usually of little general interest, etc. How much deviation from the norms is to be allowed is up to the GM. And when a character does not follow the norms, the GM needs to include plausible reasons for the differences in the character’s personal history and background.<br />
Players developing their characters should follow the normal procedure for outfitting and utilizing background options described in <a href="5500.html#RMSR_14">Section 14.0</a>. Where dice rolling is required (talents, special items, extra money), the information below should be inserted into or paired with <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#RMSR_T-1.5">Table T-1.5</a>.<br />
Remember that adventuring characters will come into contact with peoples and cultures unknown to them in their formative years. A Hillman warrior might speak only the Hill-speech and the Common-speech upon leaving his native lands and carry only his fishing spear. Six months later (possibly second or third level), he may have picked up a bit of High-elvish and be wielding a long kynac!<br />
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> Some Gamemasters may wish to include modifications for gender (male vs. female), particularly among races where there are wide gaps in size and character. (ICE suggests that this be done only in extreme cases—those where males and females differ markedly.)
</blockquote>
Sometimes a skill is listed that is not a standard skill. When this occurs, the skill category will be given in brackets after the skill name. Weapons are also listed that may not be familiar (i.e., they have no formal attack table of their own). When this occurs, see <a href="5520.html#AL_5.10">Section 5.10</a> in Arms Law for a table containing all of the necessary information on these weapons.</p>
<h4><a name="RMSR_A-3.0.0.1">A-3.0.0.1</a> MEN</h4>
<p>There are two greater groupings of Men: the High Men and the Common Men. Some speak of the Mixed Men as a third group—they are a result of unions between High Men and Common Men. Each Common Man and Mixed Man character must have a “culture”—one of the six provided in this appendix or another culure keyed to the GM’s world.<br />
The High Men are given their own entry. However, Common Men and Mixed Men must choose a culture. It is the culture that is described here (when necessary, two sets of stats are given—the first is for the Common Man, the second is for the Mixed Man).</p>
<h4><a name="RMSR_A-3.0.0.2">A-3.0.0.2</a> ELVES</h4>
<p>Though basically similar to mortal men in most ways, Elves have several important, if subtle, differences. As a race, they are taller than most Humans, although slender. Elven men have no facial hair, and as a rule, they are fairer and have less body hair than Humans. The Elves revere the Gods and many know their nature well. Still, they have no formal religion; instead they show their respect through
poetry and song and gather to celebrate life and the gifts from on high. This respect for the way of things is largely tied to their acceptance of their close ties to the Fate, although much of it also stems from an understanding and joy regarding the creations of nature. There are three types of Elves: Wood Elves, Grey Elves, and High Elves. They all have the following special abilities:<br />
<em>Cold Resistance:</em> Apparently highly resistant to extremes of natural cold, their clothing is usually for decoration, camouflage, or, perhaps, modesty.<br />
<em>Disease Resistance:</em> Their bodies are virtually immune to all bacterial and viral infections.<br />
<em>Immortality:</em> Elves do not age or grow old. Thus, they are practically immortal (excepting violent death or as a result of a weariness of the world).<br />
<em>Rest Requirements:</em> Elves do not need sleep. Instead, they receive rest through meditation involving memories, past events they recall with remarkable vividness. Normally they go into this trance-like state for approximately two hours each day (this restores Power Points as a normal night’s sleep). However, when pressed, they can function for many days with little or no relief (the restoration of
Power Points still requires 2 hours of meditation). While in their meditative state, Elves are extremely difficult to awaken; they rise at a point previously decided.<br />
<em>Night Sight:</em> Elves are able to see on a star-lit or moonlit night, as if full it were daylight. Their vision is restricted with less light—with any light source, they can see 50' perfectly and 100' fairly well. However, in absolute darkness they are no better than Men.<br />
<em>Superb Hearing:</em> Their sense of hearing is also superb (+10 to Awareness maneuvers involving only hearing), and no doubt accounts for the Elven skills with music. Their reverence for song is unparalleled and has affected their language and way of keeping precious records. The Elves were first to use spoken words and have taught the other races of the gift of speech. All of their speech has a musical quality when spoken properly, lending itself well to verse. Elven Bards, then, have had little trouble in maintaining the histories and epics of their race as a collection of wondrous songs and spoken poetry.</p>
<h4><a name="RMSR_A-3.0.0.3">A-3.0.0.3</a> ORCS</h4>
<p>There are two groupings of Orcs: the Greater Orcs and the Common Orcs. Generally, Orcs are very heavy of build, as they are bred as warriors and laborers. Common Orcs cannot stand daylight, and are at least partially blinded by the unshielded sun. Only at night can they see well (with sight like the Elves). Although Orcs are not inherently evil, they are culturally and mentally predisposed toward Darkness.</p>

<h2><a name="RMSR_A-3.1">A-3.1</a> COMMON ORCS</h2>
<p>Common Orcs fear the sun and make their dwellings in caverns beneath the mountains. Their myriad tribes prey upon the world of men, often prompted merely by a greed for plunder.</p>
<h4><a name="RMSR_A-3.1.0.1">A-3.1.0.1</a> PHYSICAL CHARACTER</h4>
<p><strong>Build:</strong> Heavy, with thick hides, short legs, and long, thin arms. They have grotesque, fanged faces and random hair growth. Males and females average 65 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>Coloring:</strong> Black or grey hair, black or reddish-brown eyes, and deep grey or black hides. </p>
<p><strong>Endurance:</strong> Tremendous. They can travel for 2 days without sleep. +20 to exhaustion points (see <a href="5500.html#RMSR_22.3">Section 22.3</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Height:</strong> Males and females average 4'.</p>
<p><strong>Lifespan:</strong> Indefinite; certainly hundreds of years, but the nature of their warlike life permits few to live past the age of 50.</p>
<p><strong>Resistance:</strong> +30 DB and RR bonuses versus heat and cold attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Special Abilities:</strong> Common Orcs sleep during daylight hours, although they need sleep only once every 3 days (more often to restore Power Points). Common Orcish vision in most darkness is as good as a Man’s during the height of day. When there is barely any light (cloudy, moonless nights; upper caverns, dungeons), Common Orcs can see at least 50' perfectly and fairly well up to 100'. In absolute darkness, they can see 10’.</p>
<h4><a name="RMSR_A-3.1.0.2">A-3.1.0.2</a> CULTURE</h4>
<p><strong>Clothing &amp; Decoration:</strong> Skins, leathers, and metal armor—crude, but well made and effective.</p>
<p><strong>Fears &amp; Inabilities:</strong> Natural sunlight and deep, running water. In full daylight, they only have 60% of normal activity each round; in artificial or magical daylight, they only have 80% of normal activity each round.</p>
<p><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Bred as laborers and warriors, Orcs respect power and terror above all things. They join and cooperate in substantial groups only when led by a “focused will,” some overwhelmingly strong individual. To them, politics equates with force, and separate Orc tribes often war. Inter-tribal cannibalism is the norm.<br />
They are, however, quite skilled. Their smiths rival those of the Dwarves and Elves and, although the items they produce lack beauty in form, they are exceptionally effective. Orcs are also fine healers, despite their lack of concern for scarring.</p>
<p><strong>Marriage Pattern:</strong> Common Orcs do not marry; they breed. The females live together in secluded areas which are normally accessible only to the strongest males. In addition, the females are receptive only to the fiercest and most attractive males. This results in the strongest offspring. The many young are kept together and raised jointly by all the female Common Orcs.</p>
<p><strong>Religion:</strong> Most Orcs worship Darkness and power.</p>
<h4><a name="RMSR_A-3.1.0.3">A-3.1.0.3</a> OTHER FACTORS</h4>

<h2><a name="RMSR_A-3.2">A-3.2</a> Dwarves</h2>
<p>Although Dwarves are spread across the world, they are close to one another and have spawned a universal reputation for ruggedness, practicality, and unwavering loyalty. Most groups favor the rocky highlands and deep caverns of the mountains. They are superior craftsmen and they love to mine the earth for precious gems and metals to forge into weapons of strength and artifacts of beauty and power.</p>
<h4><a name="RMSR_A-3.2.0.1">A-3.2.0.1</a> PHYSICAL CHARACTER</h4>
<p><strong>Build:</strong> Short, stocky, strong, with exceptionally strong limbs. Males average 150 pounds; females, 135 pounds.</p>

<p><strong>Resistance:</strong> Resistance against flame and ice: +30 DB and RR bonuses versus heat and cold attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Special Abilities:</strong> Dwarves see well in extreme darkness. In the dimmest light, they can see 50' perfectly, and fairly well up to 100'. They can see 10' in total darkness (non-magical).</p>
<h4><a name="RMSR_A-3.2.0.2">A-3.2.0.2</a> CULTURE</h4>
<p><strong>Clothing &amp; Decoration:</strong> Beards, sometimes braided. Long hair. Heavy garb with colorful hooded cloaks.</p>
<p><strong>Fears &amp; Inabilities:</strong> Open water; they do not normally swim (-50 to <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Swimmng">Swimming</a> maneuvers).</p>
<p><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Dwarves are superb miners and craftsmen, and unsurpassed stoneworkers. They live in tightly-knit groups and favor underground cities which are usually cut into rugged hills or mountains.</p>
<p><strong>Marriage Pattern:</strong> Monogamous. Only a third of the race is female. The line is traced through the male.</p>
<p><strong>Religion:</strong> Dwarves believe that each lineage has a common spirit which permeates them all and ties them together. They revere their ancestors above all other things but their maker, and believe that in each Dwarven King exists a part of his predecessors.</p>
<h4><a name="RMSR_A-3.2.0.3">A-3.2.0.3</a> OTHER FACTORS</h4>
<p><strong>Demeanor:</strong> Sober, quiet, possessive, suspicious, pugnacious, introspective, and often very greedy. Tenacious warriors, they fight without quarter and never retreat.

<h2><a name="RMSR_A-3.7">A-3.7</a> Halflings</h2>
<p>Halflings have an unclear origin, although they arose about the same time as Men. Indeed, they are said to be related to Men. They are the smallest of the races, Halflings range between 2 and 4 feet in height, and tend to be fat or pudgy. They are sometimes called “The Hairfoots” because of their large hairy feet.</p>
<h4><a name="RMSR_A-3.7.0.1">A-3.7.0.1</a> PHYSICAL CHARACTER</h4>
<p><strong>Build:</strong> They have large and hairy feet—to the point of being furry. Males average 54 pounds, while females average 51 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>Coloring:</strong> Brown skin and hair. Neat and uniformly beardless. Endurance: Halflings have a subtle ruggedness which is akin to that of Dwarves and Orcs. When pushed, they can travel long distances over tough terrain.</p>
<p><strong>Height:</strong> Males average 3'5", females average 3'3".</p>
<p><strong>Lifespan:</strong> 90-110 years. They become adults at 30. Resistance: Their feet and hands are almost immune to heat and cold. Accordingly, they are almost always barefoot. +30 DB and RR bonuses versus heat and cold attacks. Their innate simplicity and innocence gives them heightened resistance to magical attacks (this is reflected in their high racial RR modification).</p>
<p><strong>Special Abilities:</strong> Dexterous, they move nimbly and quietly. Their long, strangely slender fingers allow them to craft fine handiwork and help explain their fine reputation as thieves (this is reflected in their high racial Agility stat bonus).</p>
<h4><a name="RMSR_A-3.7.0.2">A-3.7.0.2</a> CULTURE</h4>
<p><strong>Clothing &amp; Decoration:</strong> They wear linen or wool garb—shirts, pants which fall to the upper ankle, and brightly colored vests. They occasionally don hats, but rarely wear shoes or gloves.</p>
<p><strong>Fears &amp; Inabilities:</strong> Halflings shy away from the bizarre or unusual, but otherwise have normal dispositions.</p>
<p><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Generally, Halflings burrow and dig and reside in “holes.” They are capable craftsmen, but are not friends of complex machines or magic. Their vices are few: six hefty meals a day, pipeweed smoking, and bright apparel.<br />
Most Halflings enjoy the simple life of farmers, millers, and craftsmen. Workshops and sheds dot their territories, uniformly low structures, for the halflings hate towers and rarely build above the first story.</p>
<p><strong>Marriage Pattern:</strong> Monogamous. They trace their lines through either the male or female.</p>
<p><strong>Religion:</strong> Halfling religion is without exception low-key and informal. It is actually a series of joyful celebrations centering on the gifts of Nature.</p>
<h4><a name="RMSR_A-3.7.0.3">A-3.7.0.3</a> OTHER FACTORS</h4>
<p><strong>Demeanor:</strong> Halflings are basically cheery, conservative, unassuming, and peaceful folk. Ambition is not part of their makeup. Most are conformists who avoid the unknown and shun adventure.</p>

<h2><a name="RMSR_A-3.8">A-3.8</a> High Elves</h2>
<p>The High Elves are called that ostensibly because they are considered to be the most noble of the Elves. They are said to have once resided in the land of demi-gods and may still maintain close ties to those demi-gods.</p>

<h2><a name="RMSR_A-3.11">A-3.11</a> Mariners</h2>
<p>The Mariners are descendants of High Man rebels who fled the southern empires. Most settled in the far south and began a long struggle for control with the native elements. Since that time, modest inbreeding with the locals has created a somewhat distinct group, although their High Man roots remain strong. Their heritage as sailors and merchantmen from the southern empires still influences their culture and lifestyle. They long to reclaim the southern empires.</p>

They are independent, but many have settled in kingdoms ruled by the High Elves or Grey Elves. Still, all the Wood Elf folk enjoy a good journey or adventure and most look at life much as a game to be played. Music and trickery are their favorite pastimes. The Wood Elves are also masters of the wood and know much of wood-craft and wood-lore.</p>
<p><strong>Marriage Pattern:</strong> Monogamous and for life.</p>
<p><strong>Religion:</strong> Informal and centered around communal celebration and personal meditation.</p>

They are less skilled in manuevering and manipulating mechanical devices such as locks and traps (though they are still superior to most spell users in these areas). They have the greatest difficulty learning anything connected with spells. Some literary examples of a Fighter might include Conan the Barbarian, Little John, and Gimli the Dwarf.</p>

<h2><a name="RMSR_A-4.2">A-4.2</a> Thief</h2>
<p>Thieves are non spell users who are specialists at maneuvering and manipulating. They have the easiest time learning mechanical skills (such as picking locks and disarming traps) and are fairly good at picking up weapon skills. Thieves are also unusually adept at subterfuge skills (<a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Stalking">Stalking</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Hiding">Hiding</a>, etc.). They rarely wear heavy armor, although armor does not especially hinder the exercising of their professional abilities (other than limiting their superb maneuvering abilities). Some literary examples of Thieves might include Will Scarlet and Bilbo Baggins.</p>
<blockquote>
Vylan was stalking quietly through the streets. They were mostly deserted at this hour of the morning, but you never know when you would chance upon a merchant who was trying to open his shop early.

<p>Rogues are non spell users with some expertise in thiefly abilities and a more specialized knowledge of arms than that possessed by Fighters. Normally, a Rogue will be almost as good as a Fighter with one weapon of his choice. The cost, in development points, of developing his thiefly skills will generally not allow him to be as good in these areas as a Thief, but his flexibility is unmatched by either profession. Some literary examples of Rogues might include Fahfard and the Grey Mouser, Robin Hood.</p>

<h1><a name="RMSR_A-5"></a><a name="RMSR_A-5.0">A-5.0</a> The Talents and Flaws</h1>
<p>Talents and Flaws represent unusual abilities or circumstances that are somehow related to a character. In general, a talent has a corresponding flaw.<br />
There are four degrees of talents: Lesser, Minor, Major, and Greater. Lesser and Greater talents should be examined carefully before including them in a game. The Lesser talents can easily be given out as part of a normal character’ s background; while the Greater talents have vast and broad reaching effects on game mechanics and should be carefully controlled by the GM.<br />
To determine how many background options must be allocated to gain a talent, consult the chart below. If a random talent is called for, the GM should roll (not open-ended) for the talent (perhaps re-rolling any results that are inappropriate for the character or world). The exact nature of the talent may be such that the character is initially unaware of the talent.<br />
To generate a flaw, the GM must roll on the flaw chart that corresponds the talent. For example, if the player selects a Major talent, the GM must generate a Major flaw. However, if a player is willing to take a flaw of one higher degree (i.e., a Major flaw when only a Minor talent is gained), the number of background options needed is lowered (see the chart below). In this case, a Greater Talent is taken with a Special Flaw. Because the flaw is GM generated, he may deem it appropriate not to reveal the nature of the flaw until it arises during play.<br />
A character cannot gain talents that duplicate each other. For example, a character cannot take a +3 St stat bonus and a +8 St stat bonus. However, flaws can duplicate (or perhaps contradict) talents as they are always rolled randomly.<br />
The charts on the following pages are not meant to be exhaustive. GMs should feel free to add to the charts (or modify the charts) as appropriate to his world. In the upcoming <em>Talent Law</em>, a fully detailed and much expanded version of this talents system will be presented.</p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> A GM may allow talents to be generated before a profession is chosen. In this case, the Background Options required must be allocated during the proper phase (you may not generate a talent and then decide that you do not want it).
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="RMSR_A-5.0.1">A-5.0.1</a> TOURNAMENT NOTE</h3>
<p>When creating characters for tournaments, players should always use Selected Talents. When the character is brought to the tournament, the GM should generate a flaw for the tournament. It is strongly recommended that tournament GMs already have pre-
generated flaws appropriate to the game he is running.</p>

<h2><a name="RMSR_A-5.1">A-5.1</a> The Talents</h2>
<p>This section presents four charts of the talents available (grouped by degree). Remember that each GM should examine these charts carefully. What we have classified as a Lesser talent may be a Major talent in some games. For example, being knighted may have no practical effect in some games (e.g., every minor nobleman knights every one of his sons—a lesser talent); in some games, being knighted could mean that you can gain the ear of the king if the situation is right (perhaps a Minor talent); while in other games, being knighted means you are an elite class of warrior and are deemed vastly important in the world (i.e., it’s a Major talent).<br />
Talents that are primarily keyed to spell users are marked with a †. Talents that are particular to a very cultured society are termed High-
culture talents and are marked with a ‡.</p>

<h1><a name="RMSR_A-6"></a><a name="RMSR_A-6.0">A-6.0</a> Training Packages</h1>
<p>A training package is a group of benefits (and sometimes disadvantages) that can be developed using development points. The skills and abilities gained through a package represent long periods of exposure or training (sometimes years). If these packages are developed after Apprentice level, the character should be required to spend time in training (the exact time will vary from package to package).<br />
There are two different types of training packages: Vocational and Lifestyle. Most of the time, a character may have only one Lifestyle training package (GM discretion). However, he can have as many vocational training packages as he can afford to purchase.</p>
<h4><a name="RMSR_A-6.0.0.1">A-6.0.0.1</a> VOCATIONAL TRAINING PACKAGES</h4>
<p>These training packages represent specific occupations in which a character may become proficient. He will gain groups of skills and abilities that would necessarily be developed if the character were in the occupation.<br />
For example, if the character were a member of the City Guard, he would have to know a little about how to get around in the city (as well as have some skill with weapons). The training packages that are vocational are given the type “V” in the master list.</p>
<h4><a name="RMSR_A-6.0.0.2">A-6.0.0.2</a> LIFESTYLE TRAINING PACKAGES</h4>
<p>These training packages represent groups of skills and abilities that would be gained by living a particular lifestyle. Lifestyle packages should be hard to acquire, and take long periods of time when they are allowed.<br />
For example, a character who spends most of his life around animals might develop the Animal Friend package to represent the animal skills he would have gained. The lifestyle training packages are given the type “L” in the master list.</p>
<h4><a name="RMSR_A-6.0.0.3">A-6.0.0.3</a> TRAINING PACKAGE ENTRIES</h4>
<p>Each training package gives a character one or more of the following benefits/disadvantages. In addition, each training package costs a different number of development points (based upon the character’s profession)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time to Acquire:</strong> This is the amount of time the character needs to train before gaining the benefits of the package. This time should be modified by a percentage equal to triple the character’s SD stat bonus (expressed as a percentage).
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> If a character has a +5 SD stat bonus, he would gain the benefits of a training package 15% earlier than someone with a +0 SD bonus (i.e., 85% of the normal time). However, if the character has a -5 SD stat bonus, he would take 15% longer to gain the benefit (i.e., 115% of the normal time).
</blockquote>
For starting characters, total the amount of time spent in training packages and add it to the normal starting age to determine the starting age of the character (see <a href="5500.html#RMSR_17.1">Section 17.1</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Starting Money:</strong> Some occupations (or lifestyles) have more or less starting money than others. Most packages list a modification to the “normal” starting money. This includes the starting type of coins (silver, gold, bronze, etc.). For example, if the normal starting money is 10 silver, the Adventurer package would have 10 silver plus d10 (open-ended) silver.
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> There is one notation unique to the packages: d10 (open-ended). This means roll d10; if the result is 1 to 9, keep the result; if the result is a d10, roll d10 again and add it to 9; continue until a 10 is not the result.
</blockquote>
If the training package is developed after Apprentice level, the starting money does not apply. When generating starting money, either the GM should make the rolls; or the player can simply take 51 (for each d100 roll) or 6 (for each d10 roll).</li>
<li><strong>Special:</strong> The GM should make a d100 roll (open-ended) for each item, adding the number in parentheses after the item (the items should be rolled for in the order that they are presented). If the result is over 100, the character gains the special item or quirk. After successfully gaining one item, the chances of gaining any further items is halved (i.e., the number in parentheses is halved). After successfully gaining another item, the next chance is halved again (repeating each time an item is gained). If no items are gained, the last item in the list is automatically gained (if the GM is unavailable to roll, the player should take the last item). If the package is developed after Apprentice level, the benefits gained here may be inappropriate (GM’s discretion).
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> The GM may choose to allow every character who develops a training package to have the last item in the list (even if previous items were gained).
</blockquote></li>
<li><strong>Skill and Skill Category Ranks:</strong> All packages give some skill ranks and/or skill category ranks to the character. These skill ranks represent special training that comes with the occupation or lifestyle. Occasionally, the package will list Weapon/Attack. This means that the character can choose either a weapon skill rank or martial arts attack skill rank. In addition, a Training Package <strong>cannot</strong> raise a skill rank above 10th rank.
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Kohrist takes the City Guard training package. This package awards him 2 ranks in 1-H Edged Weapons. However, he already has 9 ranks; this means that he only gains 1 more rank from the training package.
</blockquote></li>
<li><strong>Stat Gains:</strong> Some Training Packages allow the character to make extra stat gain rolls. This section shows which stats get the extra rolls.</li>
<li><strong>Cost by Profession:</strong> This section shows how much the Training Package costs (in development points) for each profession. Note that some Training Packages have a cost listed with a † and a number in parentheses. This indicates that the Training Package in not normally available, but if the GM decides to allow it, the cost in parenthesis should be used.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="RMSR_A-6.0.0.4">A-6.0.0.4</a> GAINING TRAINING PACKAGES LATER</h4>
<p>A GM may decide to allow characters to develop training packages after their Apprenticeship level. If so, the proper amount of time must be spent (as indicated in the Time to Acquire entry). The time must be continuous and uninterrupted by any major activities (i.e., the character must spend 8 hours a day for the indicated duration working on the training package). In addition, he must spend the appropriate number of development points (as indicated in the cost entry). In return, he will gain all of the skills listed with the package. The GM should decide how much money the character has gained (i.e., do not use the Starting Money entry; this is for starting characters only). Remember that a training package cannot raise any skill rank above the 10th rank. However, after Apprenticeship level, it is possible to gain another Lifestyle training package (though only one Lifestyle change should be allowed per level).</p>
<p>GMs might want to require the player to role play through some (or all) of the time spent gaining a Training Package. This could result in many interesting adventures. In addition, if the character decides to purchase a Lifestyle Training Package, he should demonstrate a change in his lifestyle.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> If Blackoak the Druid wants to get the Animal Friend Training Package after his Apprenticeship, he should spend a lot of time helping animals and befriending animals.

<h1><a name="RMSR_A-7"></a><a name="RMSR_A-7.0">A-7.0</a> The Creatures</h1>
<p>No fantasy role playing game would be complete without creatures to threaten the character (after all, not all opponents can be highly intelligent, powerful, wizards). There are two sources for creatures in Rolemaster. In the back of Arms Law (pages 136-137) there are two summary charts giving a sampling of normal creatures and monsters. In addition, Creatures &amp; Monsters (C&M) is a whole book devoted to hundreds of different animals and monsters. This section explains how to use C&M entries with your Rolemaster game.</p>
<h4><a name="RMSR_A-7.0.0.1">A-7.0.0.1</a> CREATURES ARE NOT CHARACTERS!</h4>
<p>“Creatures” is a general term used to describe both monsters and animals that can be dangerous for characters. Creatures have different types of stats than characters. In most cases, creatures do not have “skills” that they will use. Though each creature will have combat related information, they are generally not classified as skills. The types of information given for creatures will be presented in two different fashions: summary table(s) and description entry(s).</p>
<p>Listed below are descriptions of the entries in C&M. See C&M for a full description of these entries.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Type</strong> — This is the type of creature. In some cases, the entry is indented. This means that it is a sub-class of
creature under another creature. For example, under Cold Drake, there are three entries: Young, Mature, and Old. This indicates that there are three different types of Cold Drakes.</li>
<li><strong>Level</strong> — This is the average experience level of the creature. This level should be used for RR purposes. The letter code following the level indicates a variability around the average.</li>
<li><strong>Base Rate</strong> — This is the base movement rate for the creature (in its natural habitat).</li>
<li><strong>Max Pace/MN Bonus</strong> — This is the maximum movement pace that the creature can attain as well as the manueuver bonus the creature uses when making manuever rolls.</li>
<li><strong>MS/AQ</strong> — This is the manuever speed and attack quickness for the creature. These codes indicate DB modifiers in certain tactical situations as well as the creatures initiative modifiers.</li>
<li><strong>Size/Crit</strong> — This code indicates the physical size of the creature and whether or not the creature has special critical results applied to it.</li>
<li><strong>Hits</strong> — This code indicates the average number of hits the creature has. The letter code following the hits indicates the variability around the average.</li>
<li><strong>AT(DB)</strong> — This is the standard AT and DB for the creature.</li>
<li><strong>Attacks</strong> — These are the standard attacks (and their OBs) that the creature will use.</li>
<li><strong># Enc.</strong> — This is the number of creatures usually found in and/or around the creature’s lair.</li>
<li><strong>Treaure</strong> — These codes indicate the amount and quality of the treasure found within the creature’s lair.</li>
<li><strong>Bonus EP</strong> — This code indicates the amount of bonus experience points generally awarded for defeating this
creature.</li>
<li><strong>Outlook(IQ)</strong> — This code indicates the level of intelligence that an average creature of this type has. In addition,
it shows the creatures general outlook on the world.</li>
<li><strong>Habitat</strong> — This code indicates the climate and habitat for this creature.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong> — This is a physical description of the creature.</li>
<li><strong>Lifestyle</strong> — These are notes on the creature’s lifestyle.</li>
<li><strong>Combat</strong> — These are notes on the creature’s combat abilities.</li>
<li><strong>Background</strong> — This is a discourse on the background of the creature.</li>
<li><strong>Observations</strong> (not shown) — This is a personal account concerning the creature.</li>

Also shown is the standard price for the armor, how long the armor takes to make, and how much the standard piece of armor weighs. The notes section also gives further description to the armor.</p>
<h4><a name="RMSR_A-8.0.0.3">A-8.0.0.3</a> FOOD AND LODGING</h4>
<p>These are standard food and lodging services found in a medieval/fantasy setting. GMs should use the list only as a guideline, as each gaming world is slightly different (e.g., beer is only found in Country A while mead is only found in Country B). Along with the prices are shown other notes about the item (including the standard serving size or duration of service).</p>
<h4><a name="RMSR_A-8.0.0.4">A-8.0.0.4</a> TRANSPORT</h4>
<p>This chart shows the different types of transport generally available in a game world. There are two types of transport: an item (or animal) that is purchased by the character (e.g., a riding horse or a wagon) and a service that is used by a character for a short duration (a ferry or coach passage).<br />
Purchased transports are given a price that is typical of a medieval/fantasy setting. In addition, a movement rate for the item is given (in both feet per round and miles per hour). There is also a standard maneuver bonus given (as some types of transport are easier to control). Also shown is the standard size (height and weight) for the transport. In addition, the standard carrying capacity (in pounds) is shown. Finally, if the transport is capable of fighting, a standard (untrained) Offensive Bonus (OB) is given.<br />
For temporary transport, the price shown has a “per mile” addition. This reflects that the further you travel, the more you pay. The movement rates for the transport are also given. If any other statistics are needed, use a comparable “purchased” transport to determine the figures.</p>
<h4><a name="RMSR_A-8.0.0.5">A-8.0.0.5</a> WEAPONS</h4>
<p>These are all of the weapons that are typically available in a medieval/fantasy world. In addition to the price, the weapon category is shown. Also shown is the average time it takes to make the item and how much the average item weighs. Finally, some figures are given for typical breakage numbers, strengths, and fumble ranges (see <a href="RMSR_32.4">Section 32.4</a> for more on how to use these numbers).</p>
<h4><a name="RMSR_A-8.0.0.6">A-8.0.0.6</a> HERBS AND POISONS</h4>
<p>These are charts showing samples of enchanted herbs (and herbs with special healing properties) and a variety of poisons. The herb chart contains the form and preparation method of the herb. In addition, the codes showing the climate and locale are shown (along with a difficulty modifier). Also, the Addiction Factor (AF) is shown. Finally, the suggested effect for the herb is shown. The notes before the chart show further details on each of these factors. The poison chart also shows a “level” that indicates the lethality.</p>

<h1><a name="RMSR_A-9"></a><a name="RMSR_A-9.0">A-9.0</a> Optional Rules</h1>
<p>This section presents a number of optional rules that can help a GM mold the RMSS to better fit his world system. They can provide more flexibility and detail within the framework of the basic rules. However, they can involve complications and additional bookkeeping. A GM should examine these rules and determine which ones are appropriate for the pace, flavor, and detail he wishes to inject into his game.</p>
<h2><a name="RMSR_A-9.1">A-9.1</a> TRAINING</h2>
<p><a href="5500.html#RMSR_7.3">Section 7.3</a> suggests requiring two hours of “practice” or “contemplation” for each skill rank or skill category rank developed. This section presents a more comprehensive approach that provides a more realistic slant on handling training.</p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> The issue of training and the resources and facilities required for training will be handled in detail in Gamemaster Law.
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="RMSR_A-9.1.0.1">A-9.1.0.1</a> BASE TIME TO TRAIN</h4>
<p>The time required to train is based upon the rank that the character is attempt to learn. The higher the rank, the longer it should take to learn. For each rank, the Base Training Time Chart provides the required training based upon a scale using days. A GM may wish to wish to change this scale in order to decrease or increase the amount of time his characters must devote to training.</p>
<table summary="" >
<tr><td>Scale</td><td>Ratio to Base Training Time</td></tr>
<tr><td>Very Low</td><td>1 day = 1 hour </td></tr>
<tr><td>Low</td><td>1 day = 2 hours </td></tr>
<tr><td>Medium</td><td>1 day = 4 hours </td></tr>
<tr><td>Base</td><td>1 day = 8 hours </td></tr>
<tr><td>High</td><td>1 day = 16 hours </td></tr>
<tr><td>Very High</td><td>1day=32hours </td></tr>
<tr><td>Extremely High</td><td>1 day = 56 hours</td></tr>
</table>
<p>It is presumed that a character can spend roughly eight, uninterrupted hours each day training with a skill. If the character has a teacher who has a higher skill rank than the skill rank that the character is trying to learn, training time is decreased by 10%. If the character has access to proper facilities, he can decrease the training time by 10%. If the character has access to books and/or other resources, he can decrease the training time by 10%. All of the decreases listed above are cumulative (i.e., add the percentages together, a maximum of a 30% decrease).</p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> While teaching, a teacher cannot be training with his own skills. Also, there are usually a limited number of students that can use facilities and other resources (GM’s discretion).
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="RMSR_A-9.2">A-9.2</a> VARIABLE STAT BONUSES BASED ON SKILLS</h2>
<p>In the RMSS, all skills within a category use the same stat bonuses. If a GM wishes a finer granularity in individualizing skills, he can assign two stat bonuses to the category and then a third to each individual skill.<br />
When using this optional rule, each skill category bonus uses the first two stat bonuses given for the skill category (given in the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#RMSR_T-2.5">Skill Summary Table T-2.5</a> and <a href="RMSR_A-1">Appendix A-1</a>). Then, each skill gets a special bonus that is equal to the stat bonus for the stat given in brackets (i.e., {xxx}) after the skill’s description in <a href="#RMSR_A-1">Appendix A-1</a>.<br />
The net result is that three stat bonuses affect each skill bonus (just as they do if this optional rule is not used).</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> The <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Awareness_Searching">Awareness • Searching</a> category has eight skills listed in it. The stats that give the stat bonuses for the category are “In/Re/SD.” If this optional rule is being used, the skill category bonus would be figured as normal, except that only the In and Re stat bonuses would be added in. As each skill is developed, it would receive a special bonus equal to the stat bonus for the individual skill. <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Detect_Traps">Detect Traps</a> and <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Locate_Hidden">Locate Hidden</a> would get a special bonus equal to the In stat bonus. <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Lie_Perception">Lie Perception</a> would get a special bonus equal to the Em stat bonus. <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Poison_Perception">Poison Perception</a> would get a bonus equal to the Me stat bonus. <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Observation">Observation</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Reading_Tracks">Reading Tracks</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Sruveillance">Surveillance</a>, and <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Tracking">Tracking</a> would get a special bonus equal to the SD stat bonus.
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="RMSR_A-9.3">A-9.3</a> RESTRAINING MAGIC</h2>
<p>If a GM wishes to use a world system where the use of magic is relatively rare and dangerous, he can use the guidelines in this section.<br />
To restrain magic, a GM can use two principal dangers. The first of these is the existence of a “great evil force” that actively searches for and either destroys or corrupts users of magic. For Gamemasters who want to encourage restraint in spell casting, <a href="#RMSR_A-9.3.1">Section A-9.3.1</a> presents a mechanism for reflecting this danger.<br />
The other danger is the corrupting influence of the use of significant magic for “non-pure” goals. Unless a spell is cast for the purposes of combating Darkness or maintaining the “Balance,” there is a chance that the caster will be corrupted, “drawn towards darkness.” This is what happened to Saruman—he used too many powerful spells, too often. <a href="#RMSR_A-9.3.2">Section A-9.3.2</a> presents a mechanism for reflecting such corruption.</p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> A “great evil force” can actually be of any alignment (see <a href="5500.html#RMSR_16.1">Section 16.1</a>).
E.g., “great good force” could be suppressing magic, a “great capitalistic force” could be “taxing” spell usage, etc.
</blockquote><blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> In the Third Age of Middle-earth, the use of magic was quite subtle and rare—a result of the presence of
the “great evil,” Sauron of Mordor. The other masters of magic in Middle-earth employed their abilities in relative secret. Magic-users were relatively rare, and open displays of power were still rarer. Elves certainly employed magic in daily life, and Dwarves used spells for a variety of reasons. Nonetheless, such enchanting skills were not necessarily the norm.
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="RMSR_A-9.3.1">A-9.3.1</a> RISK FACTORS</h3>
<p>One of the primary reasons for the subtle and secret use of magic and spells is the presence of a great evil that actively searches for
the use of magic. Those who live under this threat must be particularly careful not to cause attention to be brought upon themselves.<br />
The danger that a “great evil” presents to spell casters is reflected by “risk factors.” Each spell type has a risk factor which reflects the potential of drawing the attention of the great evil or its minions. Each Gamemaster must decide whether or not to use risk factors in his game.</p>
<h4><a name="RMSR_A-9.3.1.1">A-9.3.1.1</a> USING RISK FACTORS</h4>
<p>Each time a character casts a spell, the Gamemaster should make an open-ended roll and add the risk factor for the spell’s type. The risk factor can be determine from the Risk Factor Section on the Spell Use Risk Chart by cross-indexing the spell’s type and the “activity level of the great evil.” For his world, a GM must decide how active the great evil is at the current time.</p>
<strong>Spell Use Risk Roll</strong> = open-ended roll + Risk Factor
<p>If the modified result is 100 or more, some sort of “Evil-force” has noticed the casting of the spell. A second open-ended roll must
be made on the Spell Use Risk Chart. Otherwise, nothing unusual happens.<br />
The results on the Spell Use Risk Chart are guidelines to help a Gamemaster determine the consequences of the spell being noticed. The GM should modify the results to reflect the specific area and circumstances.</p>
<h3><a name="RMSR_A-9.3.2">A-9.3.2</a> CORRUPTION</h3>
<p>If a GM uses these guidelines, whenever a spell failure occurs there is a chance that the spell caster will be partially corrupted and “drawn towards the darkness.” The spell failure is resolved normally, and the same roll is applied to the Corruption Point Chart to determine how many Corruption Points (CPs) the spell caster receives.<br />
When this happens, the spell caster is allowed to make a Resistance Roll against Essence (the attack level is the level of the spell being cast). If this RR is successful, only half (round down) of the CPs are received; otherwise, all of the CPs are received.<br />
A Gamemaster should not apply Corruption Points (CPs) if an appropriate spell was cast for “pure” goals (i.e., directly working against or fighting evil, protecting the weak and helpless, healing the sick and injured, etc.). The key word here is appropriate. For example, a Fire Bolt is not appropriate to use on a bully or a thief but a Sleep spell might be.<br />
A GM may also want to have “evil” items give Corruption Points when they are used. The origins of any item are very important, even innocent spell adders and multipliers—if an item was made by the “great evil” or one of his minions, its use will affect the user negatively even if only in a minor way. In this case, each time a character uses an evil item, he must make an RR against Essence (the attack level is 10). If this RR is successful, no CPs are received; otherwise, one CP is received. Certain very powerful evil artifacts may give more than one CP when this RR results in failure.</p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> A Gamemaster may wish to use a RR against the realm of power of the spell being cast.
</blockquote>
<p>The Gamemaster should keep track of each character’s CP total as play progresses. Each character’s CP total normally starts at zero, and increases through spell failure and using evil items. A GM may also want to assign CPs for particularly evil acts by characters. A GM may wish to allow certain rituals at certain places to “cleanse” (i.e., remove) CPs from characters.<br />
In general, a character’s CPs reflect his tendency towards evil. On this scale, a total of zero indicates an “innocent” and a 100+ indicates a totally evil being. The effects of Corruption Points is up to the GM and the player of the corrupt character, but we suggest the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the character is faced with temptation, the GM may make an open-ended roll and add the character’s CP total and subtract three times his Self Discipline stat bonus. A result of 100+ means that the character must give in to the temptation.</li>
<li>If the character is in the presence of an “evil being” who commands the character to do something, the character must make an Essence RR modified by subtracting his CP total and adding his three times Self Discipline stat bonus (use the evil being’s level for the attack level). Failure means that the character must obey the evil being’s command.</li>
</ul>
<p>A RR should be made for each such command. During a given day, each RR is modified by an additional +5 for every such RR already made that day (e.g., the sixth RR against evil commands made on a given day would have a +25 RR modifier.</p>
<h2><a name="RMSR_A-9.4">A-9.4</a> SELF DISCIPLINE FOR MENTAL INITIATIVE</h2>
<p>Normally an initiative roll (see <a href="5500.html#RMSR_18.1">Section 18.1</a>) is modified by a character’s Qu stat bonus. If this optional rule is used, an initiative roll is modified by the SD stat bonus (instead of the Qu stat bonus) for a mental action. A mental action is a “non-physical” action, e.g., talking, doing basic math, most self control static maneuvers, etc. For these purposes, casting a spell is considered to be a mental action.</p>
<h2><a name="RMSR_A-9.5">A-9.5</a> VARYING INITIATIVE</h2>
<p>A GM can vary the effect of Quickness on initiative by basing initiative rolls (see <a href="5500.html#RMSR_18.1">Section 18.1</a>)
on 1d10 or 3d10 instead of 2d10. A 1d10 based initiative roll will make Quickness more important, while a 3d10 based initiative roll will make it less important.</p>
<h2><a name="RMSR_A-9.6">A-9.6</a> MISSILE WEAPONS IN MELEE</h2>
<p>In general, missile weapons cannot be used while engaged in melee (see <a href="5500.html#RMSR_18.2.7">Section 18.2.7</a>). However, a GM may allow a relatively small one-handed weapon (e.g., a thrown dagger) to be thrown during melee in certain situations.<br />
The potential firer must declare a normal melee attack (i.e., he may parry normally), and he receives a -2 initiative roll modification. The thrower should make a static maneuver roll to see if he can throw; this roll is modified by triple the thrower’s Ag stat bonus or his “thrown weapon in melee” skill bonus (a Combat Maneuver skill). If successful, the thrower throws his weapon normally; otherwise, he throws his weapon with a special modification in addition to other modifications. The special modification is: near success: -25; partial success: -50; failure: -75. In any case, the character does not make a normal melee attack.</p>
<h2><a name="RMSR_A-9.7">A-9.7</a> SHIELD BASH</h2>
<p>A character may use his shield as a weapon. Such an attack is called a “shield bash” and is treated as a “Small Bash” attack (use <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#AL_T-3.10">AL Attack Table 3.10</a>). Skill for this “attack” is developed as if it were a One-Handed Concussion
weapon. All of the Two-weapon Fighting skill rules apply (see <a href="#RMSR_A-1.11">Appendix 1.11</a>). The -20 modification for non-dominant hand use applies if the shield is used on the non-dominant arm.<br />
If using this rule, a shield may still be used for its normal defense function as outlined in <a href="5500.html#RMSR_23.2.2">Sections 23.2.2</a> and <a href="5500.html#RMSR_23.4.1">23.4.1</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="RMSR_A-9.8">A-9.8</a> ARMOR DAMAGE</h2>
<p>A GM may want to keep track of the damage done to armor; if so, use the guidelines presented in <a href="5520.html#AL_5.8.8">AL Section 5.8.8</a>. Keep in mind that these procedures can involve quite a bit of bookkeeping.</p>
<h2><a name="RMSR_A-9.9">A-9.9</a> LINEAR STAT GAINS</h2>
<p>The stat gain method presented in <a href="5500.html#RMSR_12.2">Section 12.2</a> gives non-linear results. For more linear results, a GM can use the following for each stat gain roll:</p>
<strong>Stat Gain</strong> = 1d (potential stat - temporary stat)
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Dana has a 98 potential SD stat, but his temporary SD stat is only 43. So when he make a stat gain roll for SD, he rolls 1d55 (i.e., roll 1d100 and reroll results of 56 to 100).
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="RMSR_A-9.10">A-9.10</a> BACKGROUND OPTIONS</h2>
<p>A GM may want to allow his players to use a background option to select an “occupation.” This can be handled as outlined in the Layman profession description in <a href="#RMSR_A-4.5">Appendix A-4.5</a>.<br />
In addition, a GM may want to allow his players to use a background option to increase the value of his potential stats. Each background option used in this way gives the player “20 points” to assign to his potential stats. If a stat is 90 or less, one of these points can raise a potential stat by one. If a potential stat is above 90, the number of points required to raise a stat by one is equal to:</p>
(minimum points required for the stat) - (minimum points required for: stat+1)
<p>The minimum points required are given in the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#RMSR_T-1.2">Stat Assignment Table T-1.2</a>. A stat may be raised more than once using the 20 points provided by a background option.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Dana has a 98 potential SD stat and a 57 potential ME stat. He uses a background option to get 20 points to raise his potential stats. A 98 stat requires a minimum of 154 points (see <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#RMSR_T-1.2">Table T-1.2</a>) and a 99 stat requires a minimum of 171 points. So, Dana uses 17 (171-154) points to raise his SD potential stat to 99, and he uses the remaining 3 points to raise his Me stat to 60.
