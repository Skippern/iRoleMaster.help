<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>The most important aspect of any <strong>Rolemaster</strong> campaign has to be the characters. Everything revolves around what they do, how they do it, and most importantly why they do it. The beller developed the characters are, (he beller the campaign will be.The Gamemaster can spend hours planning intricate plots and sub plols. but if the characters themselves are nothing better than mediocre, all the Gnmemaster's planning could be for naught.</p><p>When a character has a complete background, it gives the Gamcmasler much more to work with in Icnns of setting up an adventure. As your gaming group's Characters start to become more developed, the adventures should become equally more developed. A campaign that started outwith "You were hired by a wizard in a tavern to retrieve an item stolen by a party of orcs..." could tum into something like "Your cousin. the Grand Vizier of the Northern Marshes, is currently trying to throw your parents off or the throne. He has been consulting with men of a darker profession. seeking to enlist their aid in his bid for power. Not only that. but the bounty hunter who has been trailing you for the past two months has instigated an effectivecampaign against your inlegrity; townspeople who once thought you were their hero have hcen repulsed with the tales (all false) of your brazen disregard for the morals of the town. Meanwhile, in another part of the town..." It is easy to see how a detailed character aan Iead to adetailed campaign.</p>
<p><em>Talent Law</em> will allow a player more diversity increating their character. No longer will their background he determined by a mere roll of the dice. Each background option, skill choice. and racial advantage will be selected by the player himself. The player may build an entirely new race, if desired, complete with its own culture, racial abilities and disabilities, and any particular quirks the player wishes to grant this new race.</p>
<p>Also included in <em>Talent Law</em> are guidelines for creating a believable and unique character. Parentage, culture, religion, and other facets of a charactcr's life are all discussed with suggestions to breathe life into your paper character.

<h1><a name="TL_1.0">1.0</a> HOW TO USE THIS BOOK</h1>
<p>Talent Law provides a different way for players to create the background's of their characters. Through a point-based system, players get exactly the talents they desire. It is the job of the GM to ensure that the talents that a player chooses do not unbalance the game. If the players become too powerfull too quickly, the campaign can quickly degenerate into a "Monty Haul" type adventure with little more to challenge the characters than a more-powerful monster.</p>
<p>To this end. the OM must determine the power level he wishes for his campaign and alter the available lalents and flaws appropriately. In some cases, the OM may wish to prevent players from choosing cerlain types of talents, Mental Abilities for example. deeming that these talents just do not fit into the GM's world.</p>
<p>The point costs for each talent and flaw found in this book are merely recommendations. The GM should not feel constrained to these costs, The point cost system as it is setup in this book is designed for a high-fantasy campaign with powerful characters making great changcs in mecampaign world. Not every game world will be similar to this and thus the point costs should be allered. The fol lowi ng are a few suggestions for GMs:</p>
<blockquote id="option"><strong>Option 1:</strong> For each talent a player chooses, the GM assigns a flaw with an equivalent point cost. These flaws do not contribute to the character's total Talent Points, If a player does not wish to receive an equivalent flaw. he must pay twice the cost of the talent.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="option"><strong>Option 2:</strong> Double the cost of the second Talent from the same category as a previously chosen talent (triple the third, etc.). Half the cost of the second Flaw from the same category as a previously chosen talent (third the third, etc.).</blockquote>
<blockquote id="option"><strong>Option 3:</strong> The GM may double. triple, or even quadruple the point costs of all talents if he feels that the costs are too low. The flaw's costs should not be altered in order to keep balance. Note that the more a talent's cost is increased, the less impact an individual flaw will have on the character's total Talent Points.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="option"><strong>Option 4:</strong> The GM may assign a multiplier to all talent's of a particular category. For instance. the OM may decide that Mystical Abilities are rare in his low-magic world and thus all Mystical Abilities are three times more expensive.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="option"><strong>Option 5:</strong> The GM may create a table for each profession that states the multiplier for each category of talents. He may feel that your profession would have a profound impact on your talents (or vice-versa). For example, the OM in your campaign feels that warriors. by nature of their profession, will not be very adept with Mystical, and Special Abilities. There fore all fighter's in his world will pay twice thecost for Mysticaland Mental Abilities and three times the cost for Special Abilities. This option requires a liUle more work from the GM in generating the tables for each profession. but it can provide the most logical reasons for restricting certain talents.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="option"><strong>Option 6:</strong> The GM may ban a particular talent or even an entire category of talents from his world. For instance. the GM may feel that the Special Abilities have no place in his world and are therefore unavailable.</blockquote>
<p>These are merely suggestions. whichever option or combination ofoptions the GM wishes to use are obviously acceptable. In fact the GM may decide on an entirely different way to control the distribution or talents and flaws.</p>
<p>It is strongly recommended that the GM not lower the costs of any of the talents. The only exception to this rule is for points gained or received from Status. It is possible that the status and reputation of it character will have little effect on the daily life of the characters. and therefore are not worth as many points asacomparable talent. Of course, the GM may decide that Status is extremely important and will effect the character orten. If that is the case then the point costs for Status should be raised accordingly.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5523/1.1/WHAT TALENTS ARE NOT" -->
<h2><a name="TL_1.1">1.1</a> WHAT TALENTS ARE NOT</h2>
<p>It is important for the player and GM to understand what talent's actually are. The purpose of talent's is not to provide a way for characters to wield super powers, but rather away to describe the natural ability or power a particular character was born with erearned. They are first and foremost background material.</p>
<p>Every talent, as well as flaw, should have some form of history with it. In fact. the GM may insist that a shon description of how the character acquired a particular talent or flaw be provided before the GM will approve the character.</p>
<p>These descriptions should be more detailed than mcrely "my character was born with this ability" or "my character was raised by a group of monks who taught him how to do this." Those statements may be true, but they do not tell the entire story. If your character was born with the talent, then why was he chose to have the talent? Was his father blessed by the gods for some good deed? Was their a curse lifted from the character's family that provided the character with this talent? Or perhaps the character's birth itself was a unique occasion that blessed the character with the talent. The answers to these questions will not only help satisfy the GM thaI the talent is critical to the character's background, it will also help solidify the character's history in the player's mind.</p>
<p>The same can be said for naws although there is little chance that a player would allempt to abuse the naw system. A one-legged, paranoid, overconfident. hemophiliac will most likely not survive his first encounter. Each flaw does however add another piece of history to the character. The above character's overconfidence easily explains his one leg , but why did he become overconfident in the first place? Did his overconfidence lead to his paranoia? Perhaps because he was a hemophiliac, a disease that ran in his family, the character's mother told him he was special and needed to avoid conflict. The character may have confused his mother calling him special, thinking that his mother was calling him blessed. This lead to his overconfidence and subsequently to his current leg count. Already we know a lot about this character's personality just from creating a background based on the character's flaws.</p>
<p>To reiterate, the talents chosen by a player do not represent super powers bestowed upon the character by the gods (necessarily). There must be a rational explanation on why the character has a particular group of talents and why they are important to a character's background.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5523/1.2/WHAT TO DO IF THE GAMEMASTER VETO'S YOUR TALENT CHIOCE" -->
<h2><a name="TL_1.2">1.2</a> WHAT TO DO IF THE GAMEMASTER VETO'S YOUR TALENT CHOICE</h2>
<p>There may come a time when a player feels that his talent choices were the perfect ones for his character and the GM disagrees. It is important for the GM to explain the overall power level of his campaign. Almost all game balance problems can be tied to characters becoming too powerful for the world they are in. The GM has a lot of control over how tough the characters become through availahility of items, creatures encountered, magic's use, enchanted items, etc. All of the ahuve items could he overcome hy a particularly talented character. If such a character is created, the GM has no choice but to veto the character's talents in order to keep the game from degenerating.</p>
<p>The player may not agree with the GM about the character's suitahility in the game world and should discuss why the character is deemed too powerful. Generally a quick conversation will solve any potential problems between the GM and player. lf this does not happen then the player will have to choose the character's talents again. This usually does not involve a lot of bookkeeping and calculations because most of the time it is only one or two talents that keep the character from being playable.</p>
<p>The first thing a player must do is determine if a particular talent is integral to the background of the character. If you find that the character could have evolved equally well without the talent, get rid of it. Replace it with something more palatable to the GM. lf, on the other hand, the player decides that the talent is too important to the character to get rid of it, then he must make a few choices. The first is to reexamine the dcscriplion of the talent to ensure that it does what the player wants it to do. Sometimes a description is misread and it changes the actual way a talent performs.</p>
<p>If the talent does do what the player wants it to do, then he should look to see if the talent is one of the many that can be bought at different strengths. If so, the player may opt to choose one of the lesser levels of the talent in order to keep the character's background the same and satisfy the GM.</p>
<p>If the talent is not one of those that may he bought in levels, the player must closely examine the reasoning for the lalent. It may be that the background or personality that the player wants for the character may be better explained with a different talent, or better yet, a naw. For example, suppose the GM decides that your choice of talents is a little too unbalancing for his campaign. After discussing it. the both of you decide that the talent that is the most unbalancing is Immovable Will. Immovable Will is not available at different power levels so you cannot purchase it at a lower level. Examining the character's personality a little closer you detennine that what you like most about Immovable Will, other than the bonuses to Sleep and Charm, was the fact that it made it difficult to change the character's mind about his decisions or his beliefs. This is what the player genuinely desires for the character. After discussing this with the GM, the GM mentions that perhaps rather than the character having an Immovable Will, the character is in reality just a little Stubborn. The player agrees with Ihis. Not only did the player get to keep the character's original conception, he is also able to spend more points on other talents.</p>
<p>Even if the GM vetoes a particular character's talents, it is almost always possible to make a few changes and still retain the same character that the player desires.</p>
<p>Finally. remember that players are not the only ones who have talents and flaws. Every NPC will have his own share of talents and naws. Each talent and flaw should also determine the NPC's personality as it does the player's. A NPC with a full background will help the GM give life to his world and a sense of history that draws Ihe players into the game.</p>

<h2><a name="TL_1.3">1.3</a> A FINAL WORD</h2>
<p>All good role-players know that acharacter is more than just a collection of numbers on a pieee of paper. In the player's mind there is a living breathing persona in that the collection of numbers helps define. Integral to this persona is complete background and personality. Without these, the charncler is merely a means to determine success or failure of a par1icular action. A cluster of numbers and percentage chances that go blindly through a gaming session waiting for the next opportunity to roll the dice.</p>
<p>The character's background and personality are actually two facels of the same thing. An individual's personality is detenllined by their background. Their background shapes their perception of the world and their attitude towards adversity. If you know a person's background you can generally predict their personality.</p>
<p>Talent Law is an aid to players in creating the background of their character's as well as a reward system for generating the character's background. Each talent, flaw, status, or item that a player chooses is another facet of the character's personality being revealed. It is important to realize that the various talents and flaws are not merely little bonuses and penalties to certain situations the character finds himself in, they are an integral part or the character and should nut be merely chosen based on how useful a particular ability is.</p>
<p>If it seems that there is a lot more pressure placed on and naws that is because there is. A story without character's is mcrely a selling. A story with mundane and unexciting character's is boring. A story with a great selling and mediocre characters is interesting. A story with a mediocre selling and great characters is enjoyable. A story with a great setting and great characters is exiting. It takes both a good setting and good characters to create a memorable campaign. The setting is the GM's job, the characters are the players' job.</p>

<h1><a name="TL_2.0">2.0</a> CREATING A CHARACTER's BACKGROUNG</h1>
<p>In the <a href="5500.html"><em>RMSR</em></a>, a character's background is detennined through the use of background options. Each race has a different number of background options to balance the race'! relative bonuses with the other races. With the background options, a playcrmay roll the dice on a number of tables, or exchange options for a skill bonus. stat gain rolls or select a t.alent with a possible corresponding flaw.</p>
<p>In <em>Talent Law</em>, the concept of background options is replaced with a poinl·based options player purchases abilities, status, and Items with his points. If the player feels he needs more points. he may choose to accept some flaws. The GM will look over the completed character's background to make sure everything will fil into the GM's world. possibly suggesting different ways to build a character background the player likes.</p>
<h5><a name="TL_2.0.0.0.1">2.0.0.0.1</a> STARTING OUT</h5>
<p>The number of Talent Points a character starts with is determined by their race. With these Talent Points. a player buy choose various talents, wealth, status, and items (subject to GM restriction). See <a href="#TL_1.0">Section 1</a> for various ways that Talent Points can be balanced.</p>
<p>Below is a chart summarizing the sixteen races found in the <em>Rolemaster Standard Syslem</em>. If your GM has made new faces for your world, or modified existing races, then he will give you the amount of Talent Points you may spend.</p>
<blockquote id="option"><strong>Option:</strong> As an option, the GM may decide that instead of using the above Talent Points, he may give a flat ten Talent Points per background option the race normally receives.</blockquote>

<h1><a name="TL_3.0">3.0</a> TALENTS</h1>
<p> Everybody has a talent, something they are gifted in doing. Talents may be learned, inborn, or even acquired during journeys. <em>Talent Law</em> supports five different categories of talents: Special Training, Physical Abilities, Mental Abilities. Mystical Abilities. and Special Abilities.</p>
<p>As you read the talent description. you will notice each is broken into two parts. The first part is the actual game description, including the benefits and penalties each talent bestows, along with the cost of the talent. The second part is a piece ofshort prose describing how you could possihly have acquired the talent. You shauld choose how you actually acquired the talent. the prose is just to get you thinking.</p>
<p>As you read the descriptions of the different talents you will undoubtedly see many that seem perfect for your character. Jot down their names and costs on a piece of paper. Once you have scanned through all of the talents and noted the ones that interest you, remove talents that do not fit your character or for which you cannot justify the point cost. When you have shortened the list to a manageable length. think about how your character gained each of his abilities. These talents should be more than just bonuses to your character. They should tell the history of your chacter, what he did as a child, how others feel about him, even how he received his education. Each talent should have its own story.</p>
<p>Not all talents are available in all game worlds. Your GM will tell you how many, if any, of each type of talents are acceptable in his world.</p>

You must have some knowledge the person you are looking for, someone you have met, a picture, something they have touched, or a detailed description.

For every point of damage that you would receive from that attack, you instead add one point to either your current Hits or your current Power Points (chosen when this talent is selected). You do, however, still suffer the affects from any critical the attack delivers.

<p><a name="Sonar_Sense"></a><a href="../en.lproj/talents.html#Sonar_Sense"><strong>Sonar Sense</strong></a> &mdash; Your body emits a sonar "ping" and analyzes the returning sound, which can compensate for blindness. Under normal circumstances, you can see outlines of anything surrounding you for a range of 25'. If you are in a denser material (e.g., like water), the range extends to 75'. You cannot distinguish fine detail of items, jusl their shape. Your sonar sense is directional; it only works in the direction you "point" it. You do not have to be blind for this power to be useful, but you could be blindfolded or in dark water, and use this ability to observe your surroundings without normal "darkness" penalties. <tt>[10 points]</tt></p>
<blockquote>You have been blind since birth, but you could always "see" even without the use of your eyes. Your body seems to emit high-frequency sound, inaudible to most people.

You have no control over the summoned creature, but you receive a +20 to any skill that would allow you to direct the summoned creature's actions. You must determine what category of creature you may summon (e.g., woodland animals, insects, birds, fish, etc.). It is possible that no creature is available to be summoned, depending on your current location (as the creature must already exist in some nearby locale). You may use this summoning ability once per five levels of experience (round all fractions up). The summoned creature will remain nearby for at leasl an hour, or until it feels threatened (at which point it will run, back to where it was summoned from). <tt>[25 points]</tt></p>
<blockquote>You know that you would never be alone. If you needed some comrades, it was just a matter of calling them to you. You found as a child that you could actually summon creatures to do your bidding. You had many pets as a child, calling them when you felt the need.

Each time you teleport, it costs 5d10 exhaustion points. <tt>[30 points]</tt></p>
<blockquote>Moving from place to place was never a problem for you. You closed your eyes, made a mental gesture, and appeared where you wanted to go. The travel was instantaneous. You could not hop from one part of the country to another, at least not all at once, but you could certainly jump many miles at a time. You never told anyone of your ability, probably because they would never believe you. You can only take one person with you. You have tried to bring more, but those attempts always failed.

<blockquote>You have the ability to tunnel through the earth, making a continuous tunnel of roughly your diameter. You can carve most any substance naturally, although harder ones slow you down quite a bit.

Using this ability costs d10 Exhaustion Points per round. <tt>[25 points]</tt></p>
<blockquote>Walls, doors, chests, clothes they are all the same to you. If you concentrate you can see right through them. There is no need to pick the lock on an empty chest, no need to stealthily listen at the guardroom door for alerted guards. You can glance at these things, and their secrets are revealed to you.

<p>Status, wealth, and items are various background items that are usually inherited. You will generally receive your status from your parents, although you may perform certain actions to create a status of your own. ln some cultures, status is permanent. A person who has status lowered would probably prefer death to the embarrassment of living among lower people. In other cultures, status is not quite as imponant: there are leaders and followers. The player may determine how important their status is to them. Status itself is neither good nor bad. but it may have positive or negative affects upon those you encounter.</p>
<p>You will also probably inherit your wealth level and feeling towards money from your parents. If your parents are rich, you will probably be brought up expecting there to always be enough money. If your family is poor, even a small amount of gold would make you rejoice. Again, the choice is the players.</p>
<p>Items represent family heirlooms and inheritances. You would be quite reluctant to part with these items, even if something better comes along. The items may be magical or just well crafted. Either way, it has been given to the player to aid them in upcoming journeys.</p>

Your GM will create the story behind what caused you to be dishonored and whether or not you actually performed the deed or were framed for it by an enemy (though you should provide the GM with some ideas as to what you would like to play). You will immediately be noticed by another knight or noble as a dishonored knight with the appropriate reactions from those who notice you. You may eventually shed your dishonor, but it should be after many trials and only after definitely proving your innocence. The GM may decide that it is impossible for you to ever regain your knighthood. <tt>[0 points]</tt></p>
<blockquote>You were once a glorious and valiant knight. You fought many battles and were decorated and revered throughout the land. That is, until one day when all of that changed. You were framed by an enemy, accused of attacking a defenseless maiden. You were stripped of your knighthood and forced to always wear an emblem announcing you as a traitor to your vows.

It should be a very long and involved endeavor for you to escape their strong grip. <tt>[0 points]</tt></p>
<blockquote>You do not remember your mother well. She died when you were very young. Your father always seem to be away on government business. That left you in the care of your step-mother.

You may have been ambushed by brigands and lost your eye in the ensuing fight. You have since sworn vengeance against the band and its leader.

<p>See <a href="#Part_I">Part I</a> for more infonnation on the various ways to use Flaws.</p>

If you do, you will face a serious crisis of belief. Your code of honor must contain at least three situations, and your actions in those situations.

<blockquote>You have found that it is easy for people to waylay you. You rarely hear people sneaking around you, and if ever you are ambushed, you cannot react for a few seconds while your brain decides what to do. You do not notice the tell-tale signs of an upcoming ambush, and when you are struck from behind, it is usually quite painful.

<p><a name="Fearlessness"></a><a href="flaws.html#Fearlessness"><strong>Fearlessness</strong></a> &mdash; You fear nothing. In fact, you consider planning or waiting to be cowardly. You would rather pull out your weapon and charge headlong into battle. Whenever you find yourself in a combat situation, roll d100 (open-ended), add 40 and subtract triple your SD bonus.

You will probably not hesitate if the money-making activity presented to you is shady. <tt>[-10 points]</tt></p>
<blockquote>You need money. You have many small hoards of coins and gems secreted about the countryside, in case something happens to your normal cash supply. Any time someone apprises you of away to accumulate money, you jump at the chance. Sometimes you walk on the wrong side of the law, but that is usually where the best profit is found.</blockquote>
<p><a name="Impulsive"></a><a href="flaws.html#Impulsive"><strong>Impulsive</strong></a> &mdash; You tend to act first and think later. You do not wait around for events to unfold themselves, you charge into the fray and see what happens around you. You almost never think your decisions through. You just take life as it is sent to you. You should try hard to accurately role play this flaw. If you charge into every combat, but carefully check each door or wall for traps, the GM may invalidate your impulsiveness. <tt>[-13 points]</tt></p>
<blockquote>There are people who can collectedly discuss what to do next. They look at the pros and cons of each action and weigh them against each other. Once they have compared the options, they choose what they feel is the best action. Not you. The path of least resistance rules you. You despise plodding through stodgy discussions. You grab the first option that does not seem deadly and plow ahead. Sometimes you choose incorrectly, but you manage to make it back to safety. Action, not words; that is your motto.</blockquote>

You suffer a -50 penalty to all or your snap actions due to your indecisiveness, instead of the standard -20. <tt>[-20 points]</tt></p>
<blockquote>You hate making decisions. You have a particularly difficult time if a decision is rushed. You like to make your time, weigh all of the positive and negative aspects of the decision. You then consider a variety of options and base your decision on them. Even in the middle of a fight, you prefer to think through your alternalives, rather than just follow your gut instinct. You find yourself jumping from one idea to the next without actually using any of them. Split-second decisions are very difficult for you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>You hate elves. They act haughty and supuior because they live so long. They build their cities in the forest, singing an dancing all the time. Who do they think they are, anyway? Humans are the dominant species on the planet. Humans have built the largest cities, created the strongest societies, given the most to the rest of the world. Every time you see an elf, you feel hatred building up inside you. You would like to grab him by his pointed ears and throw him outside where you would show him the superiority of humans. That is what you would like to do.</blockquote>

You do not even like some of the things you take, but you feel compelled to take them. You are too embarrassed to return the items you take. You sell them to whoever will by them and then leave town.</blockquote>

You love to run your hands through their hair. You have no problem finding women &mdash; they are always around. You approach and talk to them, letting them know how wonderful you think they are &mdash; and how wonderful you can make them feel. Some, actually most, ignore you, but occasionally you will meet a serving wench with agreeable morals. Then you show her that you are not all talk. So many women, so little time ....</blockquote>
<p><a name="Megalomaniac"></a><a href="flaws.html#Megalomaniac"><strong>Megalomaniac</strong></a> &mdash; You believe strongly that you will fulfill a certain goal. You believe that it has been predestined that you complete your goal. And your goal is no trivial task. You may choose whatever goal you wish (subject to the GM's approval) but your goal must be grandiose. You will not let anything stand between you and your goal. People around you consider you to be much to concerned with yourself. After talking with you for even a few minutes, they should realize your megalomania. <tt>[-10 points]</tt></p>
<blockquote>You are destined to be the ruler. You take time to in form those around you of your destiny. There can be no denying your greatness, or your place in this world. You are destined to rule. Some people call you conceited, but not to your face. You are not conceited, you just know how important you are. You will not let anything stop you from realizing your goal: to become Emperor.

<blockquote>You live a pretty normal life. If you could only remember parts of it. For some unexplained reason, you have no memory of certain times in your life. Nothing appears to connect your lapses of memory; they seem to be fairly random. Your memories occasionally return, but it is very disheartening not to be able to remember what you talked about last night. You cannot remember things as well as you used to. Eventually, you might end up like an old crazy hermit in a secluded forest. Perhaps you can find a remedy before that happes.</blockquote>

You are not conscious of this, of course. You may not even know of the other personalities or you may think of them as actual people.

Even if your friends want to pursue some course of action, if you do not wish to go, you will not. They would have to do some pretty fancy talking to get you to change your mind.

You are not considered crazy, just overly concerned wilh omens and luck. You often throw soil over your shoulder if it is spilled. You are constantly knocking on wood. If a black cat crosses your path or you walk under a ladder, your whole doy feels ruined. One of your greatest fears is that you will accidentally break a mirror. You are flat sure what seven years of bad luck would do to you. On the other hand, you do have a rabbit's foot and horseshoe with you at all times, so maybe you can ward off those evil spirits.</blockquote>

Whenever you are casting a spell on the ellemy and you make a mistake, the spell targets one of your friends. This has not happened often, but it does cause your allies opprehension when you say "oops".</blockquote>
<p><a name="Lack_of_Scope"></a><a href="flaws.html#Lack_of_Scope"><strong>Lack of Scope</strong></a> &mdash; You have dirticulty controlling the scope of your spells. The area of effect for each of your spells is halved (rounded up). For example, a spell that can affect one person will still affect one person; but a spell that had a 10 foot radius would be halved to a 5 foot radius. This only affects spells with an Area of Effect with a radius or # of targets. <tt>[-20 points]</tt></p>
<blockquote>You learn spells well. You understund how to use the power around you to make a spell happen. You undestand how to best utilize your repertoire of spells. The one lesson you had a hard time grosping was the one about area of effect. You could never expand your spells to their fullest radii. You have concentrated on making you Stum Cloud expand to the radius your master demonstrated, but to no avail. You just cannot utilize your spells to their utmost.</blockquote>

<blockquote>You are great at casting spells. You can launch a firebolt and watch it strike your target's chest. You Ieap giant chasms with just a word and a motion. But problems with spells started when you tried casting spells that were to last a while. All of your spells seem to fizzle out earlier than they should. You cannot figure out why this is happening, but it is very disheartening.</blockquote>

Your whole face grows longer. You actually change into a werewolf. While you are a werewolf you have amazing agility and can pass on your curse to people you bite. You tend to go on rampages, killing livestock, animals, even people, if they threaten you. You often wake up in some forest or on a hill wearing nothing.

You have studied different tomes and learned of a certain ritual that you could perform to ensure life after death. You have performed that ritual, and are ready for your own death. When your soul finally leaves your body, your body will become either a Iich or a powerful vampire, at your discretion. It will cenainly take time to adjust to your new lifestyle. You are truly an evil and horrific creature. Upon reaching negative hits, you will not heal normally and will loose one hit per minute until you have died. In addition, you have a natural resislance to all <em>Lifegiving</em> and <em>Preservation</em> spells and spell effects; they may not normally be cast upon you at all (as you are considered an "unwilling" target).

There is a 5% chance per week that you become possessed by a demon. Every week, roll a d100 (open-ended) and add 5. If the result is over 100, you are possessed sometime during that week. The GM should randomly determine a day or the week to determine when the possession occur (you won't know when exactly, but you will know that sometime within a week you will become possessed). The possession lasts for 2d10 hours. While you are possessed, your body will be constantly trying to wreak havoc and cause suffering. Your possessed body does not care who it harms and will be under GM control for as long as the possession lasts. You are fully aware of what you are doing, you just have no conlrol over it. On rare occasions when it is absolulely necessary for you to force the demon out of your body, you may make a RR versus <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> (using at attack level of 20+2d10).

You have searchedfor help, but no has been able to prevent you from having these episodes.

<blockquote>You enjoy casting spells, and you try hard to get them right. Occasionally You get excited and lose conlrol of the power you are trying to harnessing.

<blockquote>Magic is something you will never understand completely. You can use it, even sense it sometimes, but channeling it for reasons other than a spell can be difficult. You have a hard time viewing items and determining if they are magical. You do not attune to magical items very well, and runes are very difficult for you to read. You have tried casting divinations for people, but the readings you receive are often jumbled or contradictory. You have a very difficult time perceiving the power around you.</blockquote>
<p><a name="Power_Drain"></a><a href="flaws.html#Power_Drain"><strong>Power Drain</strong></a> &mdash; You drain power from spell adders and multipliers. Any spell adder that you use has its "plusses" (or class if you are using the <a href="5601.html"><em>Treasure Companion</em></a>) reduced by one. For example, if you were in possession of a +3 adder, in your hands it would act as a +2 adder. Also, any multiplier you use will have its multiplier reduced by one, so a x2 multiplier becomes a x I multiplier. The power in the adder and multiplier will return immediately when it is given to someone without this flaw. <tt>[-20 points]</tt></p>
<blockquote>You were talking with another spell caster one evening at a local lavern. Your colleague had a ring on his hand, which he claimed increased his casting power. He said it allowed him to cast twice as many spells as he could without it. You were doubtful, but he let you try it on. You felt the power enter your body, and for a second you felt like you could cast twice as many spells as you could before. The extra power drained out of you just as quickly as it entered, though. You returned the ring, remarking on how useful that would be. You were puzzled, though; why did the power drain out of you so quickly?</blockquote>

<blockquote>Some people just cannot hold their liquor. They get drunk and throw up after only a few mugs of the local grog. You seem to be like that with power. You cast spells, resting during the evening to regain the power you used, like any other spell caster. You work hard on harnessing more power whenever you get the chance. The problem is that you do not feel that you are getting all of the power you think you should. You should be brimming with extra spell power, just waiting to cast another spell.

You have even become an official member of the thieves' Guild. You move among them, hearing their plans, receiving training from them, even teaching younger thieves. What the Thieves' Guild does not know is that you have a mission. You are waiting for the perfect opportunity to avenge your daughter's death.

<blockquote>You are powerful. But like many powerful individuals, you have a weak spot. You may be able to slay countless numbers of orcs, destroy demons with a sweep of your sword, or even slaughter a giant or two. But when it comes to Dwarves, you are vulnerable. You are not sure what it is, but Dwarves always seem to land a telling blow against you. It seems as if you have been cursed by the Dwarf god to forever be vulnerable to them.

A paladin may he sent on a quest to slay you, a god of weather may make it always rain on you, a forest would not be a sefe place if you enraged a goddess of nalure, etc. The exact specifics are left up to the GM.

<h1><a name="TL_6.0">6.0</a> FILLING IN THE GAPS</h1>
<p>Your character is more than it collection of statistics. modifiers, and assigned points. In the Rolemaster system, a character is a living, breathing, sentient being with all of the same needs and desires as you. These characters may have appeared right after adolescence, ready to rescue maidens and slay dragons, but it is important not to overlook the fact that these characters had a childhood. They had parents, grew up in a culture, and were reared to believe in certain ideals. In short, they lived long before you started playing them at first level.</p>
<p>Your character will take on a new life before your eyes. In fact, the character should eventually grow beyond what you had originally anticipated. For this growth to take place, you must know where the character came from, what he did as a child, why he chose the profession he chose, who his parents were, and the answers to other such questions about his past.</p>
<p>While you are rolling up your character, you will undoubtedly picture in your mind what it is you want this character to be like. You will assign attributes, skills, and even a profession that all fit into your conception of the character. You will choose some background options, which will explain a little about the character's early life. Finally you will set off on an adventure. It only takes a littIe more effort to generate a complele background for your character. Armed with this background, you will be much better prepared to deal with unexpected encounters and other events that might bring up your past. Imagine meeting an old childhood friend only to have discovered that he has become a pawn for an evil sorcerer. You would be much more inclined to rescue him based solely on your past friendship than if he were some stranger whose father hired you to bail his son out of trouble. Your background can lead to a much more fulfilling career as an adventurer.</p>
<p>It may sound like you have less and less conlrol over your character. In many cases, this is true. You come up with the initial conception for the character: his profession. skills, spell lists, etc. As you are adding more information to this conception, your idea of what defines the character will change. Some of the change may be expected, but a lot of it will probably be something you never would have envisioned for the character. As you define more of the character's background, the character will take on more life of his own. You will actually see this character as a complete person rather than a collection of stats. Your character will undoubtedly become like a character from your favorite book. You cannot wait to see what happens to him next.</p>
<p>So where do you start? How do you live the, first 16 years (or more) of your character's life? The first place to start is where the character grew up. The early years of your character's life will undoubtedly shape his attitude and beliefs for the rest of his life.</p>

You may have lived wilh a relative or some other guardian due to some circumstance. You should decide what it was your parents did for a living. Your wealth level should help you determine what class your parents were, and therefore help you detennine their profession. If you are wealthy, then perhaps your parents were merchants, owned an inn, or were minor nobles of the land. If you are poor, your parents may have been peasants or beggars. Perhaps a guardian took you under his wing early in your childhood. He could have been a master thief and sought someone to pass his trade along to. It is your parents, or other guardians, that form your early perceptions of the world.</p>
<h5><a name="TL_6.1.0.0.2">6.1.0.0.2</a> SIBLINGS</h5>
<p>Only slightly less imporlant than your parentage would be your siblings. You should decide how many, if any, brothers and sisters you have. You should also choose the birth order and where you fit in it. This could have a large effect on you; often the first born child receives preferential trealment as well as a lion's share of the inheritance. Perhaps you have a younger brother who is jealous of your standing in the family. He might try to undennine you whenever possible, eventually turning into an outright enemy of yours. Or perchance you have an older sister who was wed to a cruel husband, but only you know of his cruelty. You will have to find a way to rescue your sister, if she needs rescuing at all, and protect her from her husband's vengeance. Or you may have a twin with whom you have a special rapport, often adventuring together. You would easily do whatever you could to help him when needed. Choose them well. You will spend your whole life with your siblings.</p>
<h5><a name="TL_6.1.0.0.3">6.1.0.0.3</a> CULTURE</h5>
<p>What kind of culture did you grow up in? Were you raised in the middle of a bustling metropolis or in the quiet fields outside of town. Perhaps you lived in an elven village, deep in the forest; or even miles underground in a great dwarven city. Perhaps you lived with a barbarian tribe high in the mountains and spent many a summer raiding the nearby villages. Your culture will help determine your beliefstructure. lt will define the role of religion in your life and will also define your status, both in your culture and as viewed by other cultures.</p><p>Try to visualize what the day-ta-day life in your culture is. Is it an almost daily fight for survival, or is your culture one in which even the poorest people are wealthier than the rest of the world? Are your people viewed as a progressive culture by the rest of the world or are they viewed as a backwards barbaric tribe? What weapons and skills would they normally obtain, and why? What is valued by the culture and what is despised? You need to understand what is imponant in your culture.</p>
<p>The culture the character was raised in will easily shape his beliefs and desires for the rest of his life. It is possible that sometime in your character's life, a major change transfigured his culture. Perhaps his city was captured by an enemy country, or his family moved from the plains to the city. If this is the case, there may be a crisis in the character's belief system, one that may still not be resolved. This could make an interesting subplot in the character's overall life,</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5523/6.2/YOUR ADOLESCENCE" -->
<h2><a name="TL_6.2">6.2</a> YOUR ADOLESCENCE</h2>
<p>Just by creating that panial history, you already know why your character became a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Monk">monk</a>, and more importanlly, what he plans to do with his chosen profession. It is possible that your character's primary goal may be met in the course of the campaign. Once that has happened, you will have to decide what your character will do next. There is a story behind the motivation &mdash; you should do your best to find out what that story is.</p>
<p>Armed with the knowledge he gained in adolescence, your character strikes off into the world, ready to make a name for himself. He will have many varied and exciting encounters in his adventuring career. Each will gently mold him and his beliefs. Your character will subtly begin to change from his younger ways and adolescent desires. Each new experience will have some effect on his life.</p>
<h5><a name="TL_6.2.0.0.1">6.2.0.0.1</a> PERSONALITY</h5>
<p>What is your characler's outlook on life? Is he cynical about how life will treat him or are is he optimistic about the opportunities he may face? His disposition will determine how he reacts to unforeseen circumstances and how he interacts with other people. He might be very quiet, or a loud braggart. He might be fearless and charge headlong into battle, or be a borderline coward. For a more complete list you should investigate <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#RMSR_T-1.7">Table T-1.7</a> in the <em>Rolemaster Standard Rules</em>. The important thing about your character's personality is to role-play it. This helps you break the habit of saying things like "My character tells the bartender to give him a tankard of ale." Instead, you might say "Ale Barkeep! And hurry. Colmak the Conqueror is thirsty!"</p>
<p>Playing a character who has a personality similar to yours is often fun. Somewhat more challenging &mdash; and potentially more rewarding &mdash; is playing a character with a personality significantly different than yours. If you are a naturally cautious person, it could be fun to play a barbarian fighter who wears nothing but a fur loin cloth and carries a two-handed sword. At the first sign of conflict he bellows "Ya har!" and charges directly towards his foe, whatever it may be, without thought of personal safety. It can be difficult, every instinct telling you to wait and see what the enemy can do, but it can really make for an enjoyable character (just make sure you purchase lots of <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Body_Development">Body Development</a>). Your personality is definitely the most important factor in the way your character reacts to the situations he finds himself in,</p>
<h5><a name="TL_6.2.0.0.2">6.2.0.0.2</a> RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION</h5>
<p>Every person has a religion, which may range from a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Cleric">cleric</a> or <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Paladin">paladin</a> directly serving his god or goddess to someone who completely disbelieves the very existence of gods and deities. A religion, in the broadest sense, is merely a way for a character to deal with his own mortality and explain phenomena that cannot normally be explained. It is important that you understand your character's religion. Not only is what he believes important, but also how strongly he believes in it. He may be a devout follower of a particular deity, observing all of the holy days and each and every custom, or he might just go to the temple on the important days and ignore his religious life the rest of the year.</p>
<p>Certain professions (i.e., <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Cleric">Cleric</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Animist">Animist</a>, and <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Paladin">Paladin</a>) will dictate your religious strength, but other professions vary widely. Imagine a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">fighter</a> who is a devoted follower of the god of war and battles. He would be fanatic about fighting in as many conflicts as possible. He probably would feel that he grew closer to his god with every enemy he defeated (not necessarily slew). He may work to become a great general, leading scores of soldiers into battle, hoping for greater glory. Imagine a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Thief">thief</a> who paid tribute to the god of thieves but did not really pay attention to any of the other religious activities. The temple of another god or goddess would probably not disturb him too much, especially if there were religious artifacts he could "acquire." Religion is a very important part of your character's life. It dictates how he deals with the unknown. You should take time deciding what your character believes.</p>
<h5><a name="TL_6.2.0.0.3">6.2.0.0.3</a> PROFESSION CHOICE</h5>
<p>There is a reason why your character joined the profession he did. Determining why your character chose the path he did can give you great insight into the decision making process of the character. If the character is a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Cleric">cleric</a> or <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Paladin">paladin</a> did he have some deep religious experience that called him to the ministry? Did your <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Thief">thief</a> grow up stealing to survive or was he a rich kid with too much time on his hands? Was the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Magician">magician</a> fascinated with magic or interested in acquiring as much power as possible? What made the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Monk">monk</a> join the monastery? You must detennine the reason why your character chose to learn his profession.</p>
<p>The various training packages your character purchases will help shape his profession choice, and should help you decide why your character is what he is. It can help if you picture your character during the learning stages of his profession. Who taught him? How did his master feel about his accomplishments? What was his relationship with his master? These questions will help better determine what it was like learning the profession, as well as creating some interesting people in the character's past.</p>
<h5><a name="TL_6.2.0.0.4">6.2.0.0.4</a> MOTIVATION</h5>
<p>Here is the crux of your character's adventuring life. Why does he do what he does? What is in it for him? Your character's motivations will tell you what he wants to do and to what lengths he is willing to go to do it. There are many different motivation's for your character; some humanitarian, others self-serving. The <a href="5500.html#RMSR_9.2.2.1"><em>Rolemaster Standard Rules</em></a> has a list of some motivations for your character. There must be a reason why your characler has the motivation he does. If your character is adventuring to gain wealth, why is money so important to him? If your character feels a need to right wrongs, what made him feel this way? A motivation is more than a reason to adventure. Take the example of a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">warrior monk</a> whose primary motivation is revenge.</p>
<blockquote>You decide that Gaelellor's parents were slain by a particular sect of monks. He saw them murdered, but escaped. You then decided that Gaelenor must avenge the deth of his parents. He went to the monastery of a sect diametrically opposed to that of his parent's slayer. He pleaded his case to the head monk of the monastery, who decided to admit Gaelenor into the order. Gaelenor spent many years honing martial arts skills. When you Gaelenor passed the final test of his order, the head monk told him that Gaelenor had learned all the master could teach. Gaelenor now felt ready to strike vengeance on the slayer of his parents. Gaelenor was unsure how to go about doing it. He could not, after all, attack the enemy monastary and hope to survive. lt may take many years, but Gaelenor has the image of his parents being slain to keep the anger burning inside of him.</blockquote>
<h5><a name="TL_6.2.0.0.5">6.2.0.0.5</a> LONG AND SHORT TERM GOALS</h5>
<p>Similar to your motivation, your goals are what you want to accomplish in a set period of time. These goals are usually more specific than your character's motivatian, but they can be the same. An example of a short-term goal would be ridding the countryside of a particularly troublesome band of highwaymen. A long-term goal might be to establish your own city by building a castle in an important area of countryside. These goals have a definite resolution, unlike the motivation of "I wish to bring the knowledge of my god to all the people."</p>
<p>You should be certain that your character's goals are something the character would want to accomplish. A <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">fighter</a> who lives for battle would quickly get bored if he met his goal of opening his own tavern. You character's motivation should help you decide what your goals will be.</p>
<p>You should first decide on your character's long-term goal. Once that is decided, break the long-term goal into several short-term goals. Each accomplished short-term goal will presumably bring your character closer to completing his long-term goal. During the course or your character's adventures, he may develop several additional short-term goals unrelated to his overall personal goal. This is only natural, since it is impossible to predict what will next happen to your character.</p>

<h2><a name="TL_6.3">6.3</a> YOUR ADVENTURE BEGINS</h2>
<h5><a name="TL_6.3.0.0.1">6.3.0.0.1</a> TAGS</h5>
<p>A tag is something that you do repetitively and unconsciously that eventually identifies you. Everybody has a character tag, including you. There are an infinite number of different character tags your character could possess. For example, your character may constantly rub his lucky charm, or he might allways sit with his back to the wall, or he might always wear red. Anyone thing or a group of things that can uniquely identify your character is a tag. You should pick about five difrerent character tags.</p>
<p>As you role-play your character, each of these tags should eventually become evident. This helps to identify your character and bring a feeling of actually knowing the character from some of the other players in the game. These tags can be humorous, serious, annoying, helpful, even embarrassing. The important thing is to make sure that they appear whenever appropriate. After a few times of your character sauntering up to the bar and ordering a glass of Insap Green (which the bartender has never heard of), the other players in the game will begin to expect that (and the ensuing conflict that would invariably follow). When other players start to predict your charncter's actions. Then you know you have succeeded in creating believable character tags.</p><h5><a name="TL_6.3.0.0.2">6.3.0.0.2</a> FEELINGS</h5>
<p>You should determine, based mostly on what you have discovered about your charncter, how your character feels about many different aspects of his world. For example, how does he feel about the gods? How does he feel about using herbs for healing? How does he feel about <a href="../en.lproj/races.html#Dwarves">Dwarves</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/races.html#Elves">Elves</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/races.html#Orcs">Orcs</a>, or other races? These represent his gut feelings towards these things. He may change his mind over time about how he feels about specific cases. As an example, look at <dfn>Sir Nomus</dfn> a knight of some renown.</p>
<blockquote>Nomus never cared much for <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Wizard">wizards</a>. Summoning energies for spells seemed unnatural and even somewhat evil. He had slain a few wizards in his time, those that were terrifying the surrounding lands. This only increased his dislike of wizards. He never would have joined forces with one if his Lord had not insisted. He looked the mage over. He looked like a typical mage: robe, staff, and book. The rest of his party were more thrustworthy types: a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Monk">monk</a>, a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Rogue">rogue</a>, and an archer. As the small party adventured together, Nomus was forced to reevaluate his position about magic, and more noticeably, about the wizard in the party. There were at least two occasions when Nomus saw certain death awaiting them, only to be saved at the last minute by a well-timed speII from the wizard. Yes, perhaps magic has its uses after all.</blockquote>
<p>It will not happen immediately, but a character can reexamine his feelings about a group or object and find them to be unfounded. You may still have strong reelings about whatever it is, but the feeling now will be much different than those you had before.</p>

<blockquote id="example"><p><strong>Galen's Story:</strong> Galen was raised on the outskirts of the great Muerte Forest. There were always rumors that the forest was haunted, especially deep in its center, but Galen never paid much attention to that. His father, Kalmar, was a hunter and trapper, selling furs and meals to provide for his family. Kalmar taught Galen how to shoot a bow, a skill that Galen took to immediately. Galen became known as the best shot in the village where they lived, a reputation he substantiated on numerous successful hunting expeditions with his father.</p>
<p>His mother taught him how to use herbs to heal wounds and remove illness. Galen spent many hours in Muerte Forest searching for a particular root, leaf, or berry that his molher required fora brew or poultice. While he was exploring the forest, he honed his fine sense of direction. He could always find his way back to home, no matter how many twists and turns he took.</p>
<p>Galen continued to grow up around the forest. He grew stronger and more agile throughout his adolescence, able to pull even the great bow his father used on special hunting expeditions. He also tuned his fine sense of hearing. He could hear a deer panting from 50 feel away if he concentrated enough. Galen would go out with hunting parties, often acting as a scout.</p>
<p>During the village's festivals, the whole family celebrated with the rest of the townsfolk. On the full moon, he and his parents would offer their sacrifice of seed, nuts, and leaves to the spirit of the forest to ensure a bountiful month.</p>
<p>Whenever he had free time, Galen would go deep into Muerte Forest. He explored new areas of the forest, searched for herbs, and tracked animals going through the foresl. It was during one of these explorations that Galen first came across a band of <a href="../en.lproj/races.html#Elves,_Wood">Wood Elves</a> living in the forest. They told Galen of an evil deep in the middle of the forest, and how their band was trying to prevent the evil from spreading. They asked Galen if he would aid them in their goal. In return, the elves would teach Galen the secret of spell-casting. Galen could hardly refuse an offer like that, and so his traing began. For months, the elves taught Galen the ways of the ranger. Galen honed his forest skills while he learned the mysleries of harnessing energy for his spells. Finally, the time came when the Wood Elves told Galen he had reached the end of his training.</p>
<p>The small band entered deeper into the forest than Galen had ever gone. There they encountered a horror Galen had only heard about: an animated corpse. There were around a dozen of the zombies against only seven in the band. They fought hard; Galen burying arrow after arrow into the zombies' bodies. Eventually, Galen and the elves destroyed enough of each of the zombies' bodies that they could not rise to continue fighting. Galen and his group had won this first skirmish, but Galen knew they would require more help.</p>
<p>Galen vowed to protect anyone he could from the evil in the forest, and eventually purge the forest of the evil entirely. To meet that goal, Galen would need to find a band of adventures to aid him in his quest.</p>
<p>Gelan's adventure begins...</p></blockquote>

<h1><a name="TL_7.0">7.0</a> RACE GENERATION</h1>
<p>A fantasy world can be populated by an infinite variety of races. It would be impossible for any one to catalog every conceivable race that a player might wish to choose for his character. Rather than limit the available choices in <a href="5500.html"><strong><em>Rolemaster</em></strong></a>, <em>Talent Law</em> allows you to design any race that you can conceive of. You may spend points on the various racial categories and purchase unique features for your race.</p>
<p>The most important part of creating a new race is to have a firm idea of what the race is like before you start purchasing characteristics. If you can see how members the race interact with each other, with other races, even to nature, then you will have a firmer grasp on what talents and flaws to purchase.</p>
<p>Once the race is created, you should compare it to the other races in your world. Make certain that the new race balances well with the other races. Finally, write as detailed a description about your new race as you can. This will help to clarify the race in the minds of your players.</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> You decide that you would like to play a character that can fly. You picture in your mind an eagle headed humanoid race with wings. You see them as being very intelligent and educated, always willing to learn a new skill. They treat each other with a mutual respect, but treal those that they feel are less intelligent as children. They tend to live in high cliffs, due to their avian ancestry, and can use their beaks as a weapon. You tell your Gamemaster your idea for the race and he is very interested in what you come up with. You decide to call the race the Egalian.</blockquote>

<p>You start with 8 spoken ranks and 4 written ranks in your native language. Any additional languages you speak will begin at five spoken and zero written. You may increase your spoken or written ranks by paying 1 point for each additional rank. You may receive 1 point for each rank you reduce spoken or written.</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> The Egalian speak many languages, an ofshoot of their scholastic nature. They start with 4 languages, This will cost 7 points. You must also choose which languages the Egalian speak and at what level. You decide that they speak their native language (Egalian) at a rank of S8/W7, which costs 3 points. They also speak Common at S8/W5, which costs 8 points (for the 3 ranks over 5 and the five written ranks), Elvish at S5/W5, which costs 5 points, and High Elvish at S5/W5, again for 5 points.

<p>A bonus may be applied to any of your stats. These bonuses represent a race's adventages or disadventages compared to other races. You may also select a stat bonus to represent an individual who is stronger, smarter, or more agile for his race. A character can have no more than two stat bonuses applied to a single stat (one for the race and one for the character).</p>
<p>Every point bonus above ten costs and additional ten points. Every negative penalty below then grants an additional ten points.</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> Egalian are quick and agile, stemming from their avian ancestry. To fly, they must be strong. They are good thinkers and can figure out problems quickly. They are not very imposing creatures and they are fairly undisciplined. You decide their stat bonuses will look like this:

You must then break down the total number of skill ranks into the applicable skill categories, depending on what your race values the most. You will also wish to reserve some ranks to be used as hobbies. The Gamemaster may change your distribution of adolescence ranks if he feels they do not reflect the desires and needs of your race. The point cost is based on the number or ranks you need.</p>
<blockquote id="example">You feel that the Egalian have developed a widely diverse culture one that embraces many skills. To truly feel like you have grown up in this culture, you would have developed many different skills. You feel that a total of 80 ranks is necessary for youor Egalian's adolescence.

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5523/7.2/BONUS TALENT POINTS AS EXPERIENCE" -->
<h2><a name="TL_7.2">7.2</a> BONUS TALENT POINTS AS EXPERIENCE</h2>
<p>There may come a time when your players would wish to aquire another talent or possibly rid themselves of a flaw. As the GM, you may decide that this is impossible or you may allow your players to earn points in lieu of earning experience.</p>
<p>It is recommended that your players have a legitimate and logical reason why they wish to remove a flaw. This should come as the culmination of some event of a period of many game sessions. You do not want your players to buy off one of their flaws simply because it is too inconvenient for them. The whole purpose in having a flaw is that it limits you in some way. It should not be something that you get rid of after it has served its purpose.</p>
<p>Suppose one of your players has a fear of spiders (arachnophobia). The character has been adventuring for some time and is now fourth level. At this point, the player decides that a fear of spiders is not something he wants his character to have anymore. He asks the GM if there is any way he can buy off this Flaw. The GM asks the player why he thinks his character would no longer be afraid of spiders. The player thinks for a while and mentions a time when the adventuring party fought many giant spiders. His character made all of his maneuvers doring the fight and performed quite bravely. The player says that perhaps being faced with the character's worst fear and surviving it made the character less afraid of spiders. The GM feels that this example is legitimate and allows the player to buy off his phobia.</p>
<p>Similarly, you do not want your players buying any talent that they feel they need. There should be a reason why their character suddenly acquires a certain Talent. Some of the talents would be easier to receive than others, especially the Special Training category of talents. For example, if a character spent many months adventuring in a party that contained an elf, he could conceivably learn the elvish way of doing things which is reflected in the <a href="#Elvish_Training">Elvish Training</a> Talent. The other talents would be more difficult to acquire without some kind of outside influence on the character. The GM will have to decide what is and what is not possible for the character to receive.</p>
<p>If you have decided that the characters may purchase new talents or remove old flaws, you must decide how the characters will receive the Talent Points necessary to do this. There are three options for providing characters with points to spend.</p>
<blockquote id="option"><strong>Option 1:</strong> Allow characters to earn Talent Points equal to an average of their Prime Requisite bonuses each time they increase a level. This has a tendency to grant a significant amount of points over time.
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> Bosco, a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter</a>, has an average Prime Requisite bonus of +5. Every time Bosco goes up a level, he gains an additional 5 points with which to spend on a new talent or remove an old flaw.</blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote id="option"><strong>Option 2:</strong> Allow characters to purchase additional Talent Points with their awarded Experience Points. The recommended purchase amount is 1 Talent Point for every 1000 Experience Points. This forces the character to choose between advancing a level, gaining a talent, or losing a flaw.
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> The party has just returned from an adventure and the Gamemaster has istributed all of the appropriate experience points. Khufir, a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Thief">Thief</a>, has been wanting to purchase <a href="#Weapon_Control">Weapon Control</a> so he will fumble less often with his saber. The normal cost of that talent is 10 Talent Points, so it would cost Khufir 10000 Experience Points. Now Khufir must decide if he would rather gain this Talent or gain a level.</blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote id="option"><strong>Option 3:</strong> Allow characters to take additional talents or remove flaws byt they must purchase an equivalent point value in flaws. This will make the character become additionally burdened with new flaws to offset his new found abilities.
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> Nohj the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Bard">Bard</a> really wants to pick up <a href="#Ear_for_Music">Ear for Music</a> (7 Talent Points). In exchange for that he accepts the flaw of <a href="#Uncoordinated">Uncoordinated</a> (-7 Talent Points). He now is a superb, if somewhat clumsy, musician.</blockquote></blockquote>
<p>Whichever option the GM chooses, he may judge that a player cannot acquire a particular talent or flaw regardless of the number of Talent Points the player has saved up.</p>
<p>If during the course of the game a player acquires something that is equivalent to a talent, he is not required to pay for it.</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> Irwin the Fletcher, during an encounter with a hostile band of brigands, saves the life of a young noble woman. As a reward for his bravery, the young noble knights Irwin and bestows on him a small plot of land. Normally, this is <a href="#Knighted">Knighted Status</a>, but since it occurred while role-playing and not during character's creation, it does not cost Irwin any Talent Points.</blockquote>
<p>Likewise, if something terrible happens to the character that could result in a condition similar to a specific flaw, the character does not receive any Talent Points for it.</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> Khufir, our <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Thief">thiefly</a> friend from a previous example, is engaged in a desperate battle with a group of kobolds. During the fight one of the kobolds scores a critical hit with his sword on poor Khufir's arm. The Gamemaster rools the critical strike and the description states that the blow cuts off the arm. Miraculously, Khufor manages to escape with his life, but not his arm. Normally, this is considered the <a href="#One_Arm">One Arm</a> flaw, but again since it did not happen when Khufir was created, he does not receive any points for it.</blockquote>
<p>The GM should not feel obligated to provide extra Talent Points at all. If players know that they will have those flaws for the rest of their natural life (barring unusal circumstances) then they will probably make certain they are willing to role-play them correctly.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5523/7.3/CREATING YOUR OWN TALENTS AND FLAWS" -->
<h2><a name="TL_7.3">7.3</a> CREATING YOUR OWN TALENTS AND FLAWS</h2>
<p>The list of talents and flaws is an extensive one. It is not however, all-inclusive one. There is an almost infinite number of different talents and flaws that can be created. The GM may need to create a new talent for a particular NPC he has created. Likewise, a player may have a particular flaw in mind when he created his character and finds that it is not listed. If this happens, the GM may create new talents or flaws to be added to his game world.</p>
<p>To add a new talent or flaw without unbalancing the game is a difficult task. The most important factor is getting the Talent Point cost appropriate to the level of the talent or severity of the flaw. The following are a list of suggestions to adjust the point cost for the newly created flaw or talent.</p>
<p><strong>Decide on the exact game mechanism of the new talent or flaw.</strong> Figure out what bonuses and penalties it will impart on the character. Write down the mechanics as explicitly as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Compare the game mechanics of your new talent or flaw with existing talents or flaws.</strong> This should give you a gauge for the point cost of the talent or flaw. For example, if your talent bestows a bonus to a certain skill, try to find an existing talent that bestows the same bonus to a similar skill. This will give you a starting point for the Talent Point cost.</p>
<p><strong>Determine how often talent or flaw will come into play.</strong> The more often a talent is used, the more points it should cost. Likewise, the more often a flaw inhibits the player, the more points it should be worth. Certain skills will be used almost constantly (i.e., Combat Skills, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Body_Development">Body Development</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Power_Point_Development">Power Point Development</a>, etc.) while other skills call for a more specialized set of circumstances to use (i.e., <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Diplomacy">Diplomacy</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Cooking">Cookery</a>, Sleight-of-Hand, etc.). The more a skill is used, the more costly or beneficial a talent or flow, respectively, should be.</p>
<p><strong>Establis a Talent Point cost for the talent or flaw.</strong> The GM should determine a final cost for the talent or flaw. If the GM feels the talent is too powerful, or the flaw is too limiting, he may decide to not allow the talent or flaw to be made. The GM is the final authority for any talent or flaw creation.</p>
