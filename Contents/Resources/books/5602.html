<h1><a name="MAC_0.0">0.0</a> WELCOME</h1>
<p>Welcome to <em>Martial Arts Companion</em>. This book is designed to allow Gamemasters to incorporate a wider range of martial arts into the <em>Rolemaster Standard System (RMSS)</em>. Inside you will find rules for introducing unarmed combat systems and new martial arts skills. For ease of integration into the Gamemaster's campaign, the optional rules and skills introduced in this book are categorized into the three separate power levels: Core, Heroic, and Fantastic.</p>
<p>When first reading this book, concentrate on reading and understanding the core rules. Any text that is not marked as heroic, or fantastic serves as core or background information, it will be helpful to at least to skim through these sections to get a broad overview of the scope and purpose of this companion.</p>
<p>Pay special attention to the examples covering everything from character creation to combat. After you gain an understanding of the material, create a few sample characters using the core rules before tackling the optional heroic and fantastic rules and options in this companion. Afterwards, feel free to dive into the optional sections of the rules. Each optional ruling has a brief discussion of their impact upon the <em>RMSS</em> that should make the job of choosing what options to include (or exclude) in a campaign much easier for the Gamemaster.

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/1.0/INTRODUCTION" -->
<h1><a name="MAC_1.0">1.0</a> INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>This book is geared to be a useful reference for both the Gamemaster and the player. As with all companions, the rules detailed within these pages are optional. It is not recommended that the average Gamemaster use every option and rule presented in this companion. In most games, only a certain subset of the rules and guidelines presented in this companion will be used. Players wishing to introduce rules presented in this companion into a game must be aware that their inclusion may upset the gamebalance and direction intended by the Gamemaster. In this event, the wishes of the Gamemaster should be respected. Likewise, Gamemasters wishing to include the new rules and options presented in this companion within their games have an obligation to clearly explain to the players the ramifications they present to the players present and future characters.</p>
<p>This book tries to model the different approaches to martial arts within a consistent framework. To this end, a common set of martial arts rules and skills serve as the foundation for this book. Because of this structure, it is possible to embrace the many complexities of martial arts. It is important, therefore, for the Gamemaster to fully understand the power level of martial arts that he wishes to allow within his campaign. It is equally important that he convey his expectations of the capabilities of martial artists to his players to avoid misunderstandings. With both the players and the Gamemaster starting from a common set of assumptions, a campaign becomes much more stable. There are three power levels in this companion and they are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Core Power Level</strong> &mdash; The Core power level assumes a near real-world expectation of martial arts. The martial arts are treated as unarmed combat with all the inherent advantages and disadvantage that come with that expectation. The Core power level is well integrated with the entire <em>RMSS</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Heroic Power Level</strong> &mdash; The Heroic power level assumes a slightly larger-than life expectation of martial arts. The martial arts at this level are more effective than they actually are in the real world, allowing players to accomplish extraordinary acts more easily. In most cases, the Heroic power level is the average level at which a role playing campaign is run,</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fantastic Power Level</strong> &mdash; The Fantastic power level assumes an unrealistic expectation of martial arts. Martial arts are presented as the supreme form of combat and are practiced by the majority of the heroes of the campaign world. Martial arts masters can accomplish supernatural feats through the focus of their inner power. The Fantastic power level is the most potentially imbalancing option with respect to the rest of the <em>RMSS</em>.</p></li></ul>
<p>While players have a wide variety of options to choose from when using this book, it is noteworthy that the mechanisms used for resolving martial arts attacks are quite simple. In summary, Martial Arts Companion was created to enhance the enjoyment of Rolemaster players by expanding on and enhancing the martial arts system first introduced in RMSS. Furthermore, the assumptions used in creating the rules and guidelines in this book are outlined below to help the Gamemaster understand the foundation from which the rules have been generated.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/1.1/ASSUMPTIONS" -->
<h2><a name="MAC_1.1">1.1</a> ASSUMPTIONS</h2>
<p>The following is a list of assumptions for this book.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This book was created to benefit any profession in <em>RMSS</em>. Therefore, all martial arts abilities can be used by any profession, albeit at a price.</p></li>
<li><p>This book was created to expand the alternatives available to players having characters who specializing in martial arts. As a result, a system for creating unique martial arts styles was created to emphasize the uniqueness of the martial artist.</p></li>
<li><p>The changes in this companion will imbue the martial arts character with more depth and versatility, which will make this character more interesting to operate. To accomplish this, three changes were instituted:
<ol>
<li>A consistent and comprehensive framework was developed to incorporate a more detailed martial arts system into <em>RMSS</em>.</li>
<li>The range of choices available to martial artists has been increased by the addition of new skills, background options, training packages, and special talents and flaws.</li>
<li>The development point burden on martial arts characters has been lessened to allow them to pursue expertise outside the narrow range of martial arts.</li>
</ol></p></li>
<li><p>Finally, the standard <em>RMSS</em> combat round system with a 100% limit on activity and three actions per round limit is still being used to resolve combat? Note, however, that variant combat systems used in some <em>Rolemaster</em> campaigns may require some modification to complement the rules in this companion. Especially important to recognize are the changes reflected in this companion from previous editions of <em>Rolemaster</em>. These are outlined below.</p>
</ul>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/1.2/CHANGES" -->
<h2><a name="MAC_1.2">1.2</a> CHANGES</h2>
<p>The areas that have changed in <em>Martial Arts Companion</em> include professions, guidelines, skills, and weapon attack and critical tables. These are explained below.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/1.2.1/NEW PROFESSIONS" -->
<h3><a name="MAC_1.2.1">1.2.1</a> NEW PROFESSIONS</h3>
<p>While the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Monk">Monk</a> profession introduced in <em>RMSR</em> remains a valid profession, two new variant professions based on the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Monk">Monk</a> are introduced. These include the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Taoist_Monk">Taoist monk</a> and the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Zen_Monk">Zen monk</a>, both of whom specialize in unarmed combat. These introductions were motivated by the argument of whether the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Monk">Monk</a> profession was better modeled as an <span id="essence">Essence-based</span> or a <span id="mentalism">Mentalism-based</span> spell caster (Charltonian versus Amthorian view). The original <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Monk">Monk</a> profession's spell lists still retain a fair balance between the two variant professions, thus offering the most flexibility to the starting character. However, players now have the option to choose between <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Monk">Monk</a> professions, depending on which heightened attributes they wish their characters to possess.</p>
<p>The <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Taoist_Monk">Taoist monk</a> is a new <span id="essence">Essence-based</span> spell casting martial artist that differs from its <em>RMSR</em> predecessor in its ability to manipulate and create elemental forces. The advantage the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Taoist_Monk">Taoist monk</a> gains in elemental control is balanced by his lesser effectiveness both at controlling his body and focusing his will when compared to the standard <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Monk">Monk's</a> own ability to master these traits. The <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Zen_Monk">Zen monk</a>, a new <span id="mentalism">Mentalism-based</span> spell casting martial artist, on the other hand, is blessed with a superior ability to focus his will and use the power of his mind to influence the perceptions of others that out shadows even that of the standard <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Monk">Monk</a>. However, the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Zen_Monk">Zen monk</a> does not have the standard <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Monk">Monk</a> or <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Taoist_Monk">Taoist monk</a> abilities at special moving maneuvers.</p><!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/1.2.2/GUIDELINES" -->
<h3><a name="MAC_1.2.2">1.2.2</a> GUIDELINES</h3>
<p>Some new guidelines dealing with specialized combat situations are detailed in this companion. They cover everything from competing in challenges to Fighting on top of a teetering building while it is raining. These guidelines are meant to help the Gamemaster resolve the strange and interesting situations in which players invariably find themselves.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/1.2.3/SKILLS" -->
<h3><a name="MAC_1.2.3">1.2.3</a> SKILLS</h3>
<p>The most important change to the original martial arts skills found in <em>RMSR</em> is the elimination of the four-tiered degree skill system used for martial arts attacks. For simplicity, this has been replaced with a single skill for each general type of attack, of which there are four: martial arts striking, martial arts sweeping, locking holds, and nerve strikes. While the <em>RMSR's</em> original damage threshold system is still present in this book, it is now embedded in the Martial Arts Style skill. The Martial Arts Style skill allows the martial artist to create a specialized unarmed attacking system. The Martial Arts Style skill is also placed in a new skill category under the umbrella Martial Arts Group called the <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Martial_Arts_Combat_Maneuvers">Martial Arts Combat Maneuvers</a> skill category. Many other specialized martial arts skills are included in this skill category. Additional new skills are included in a wide range of skill categories, ranging from <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Lore_General">General Lore</a> skills to <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Special_Defenses">Special Defenses</a> skills. An important addition is the Weapon Style skill to the Combat Maneuvers skill category. The Weapon Style skill allows the user to create unique weapon-using fighting systems, much like the Martial Arts Style skill allows the use to create unique unarmed combat fighting systems.</p>
<p>An optional type of skill called a Chi Powers skill has been introduced to model some of the amazing feats performed by martial artists in history and legend. These skills are found in many different skill categories and are listed in their own section in this book.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/1.2.4/WEAPON ATTACK TABLES AND CRITICAL TABLES" -->
<h3><a name="MAC_1.2.4">1.2.4</a> WEAPON ATTACK TABLES AND CRITICAL TABLES</h3>
<p>New weapon attack tables offer the martial artist a greater range of choices in traditional martial arts weapons that have as of yet not been created in Arms Law format. The additional weapon attack tables for the katana, nunchaku, tetsubo, sai, kris, wakizashi, chigiriki, kusarigama, chain, thorn staff, short stick, dart, spring sword, three-sectioned staff, butterfly knife, and metal whip are listed in this companion. Other specialized martial arts weapons are profiled as well. Furthermore, two additional critical tables, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Locking_Holds">Locking Holds</a> and <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Nerve_Strike">Nerve Strikes</a>, are introduced as well to offer more effective martial arts attacks.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/2.0/HISTORICAL MARTIAL ARTS" -->
<h1><a name="MAC_2.0">2.0</a> HISTORICAL MARTIAL ARTS</h1>
<p>A martial art is an individual fighting style that is systematized and defined in a formal manner. Martial arts require long practice and rigid self-discipline to master. With this discipline comes the mental focus and accuracy necessary for success. Examples of martial arts can be found throughout history and legend from David's smiling of Goliath with his sling to the accounts of ancient Chinese fighting masters. The skills and techniques employed in martial arts are different from those used in warfare. While martial arts are driven by the dictums of accuracy and speed, mass combat or warfare is driven by the dictums of strength and firepower. Whereas the weapons used in warfare are large and heavy and fighting can take days, the combat practiced by the martial artist is free of restraint and swift, with the focused objective of neutralizing the foe as quickly as possible.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/2.1/THE ORIGINS OF MARTIAL ARTS" -->
<h2><a name="MAC_2.1">2.1</a> THE ORIGINS OF MARTIAL ARTS</h2>
<p>The true beginnings of martial arts are clouded in myth, since most ancient martial arts masters kept little records. Instead, techniques were handed down from master to disciple. Because of a master's untimely death or failure to locate a gifted protege, many unique martial arts styles and their origins have been lost. It is generally agreed, however, that martial arts; first took root in the Asian cultures of the East. Furthermore, it is believed that the religious traditions and medical knowledge practiced in this area were instrumental in developing the forms and style of martial arts we recognize in all the evolved forms of martial arts preset today.</p>
<p>The omnipresent element of inner strength and focus in all martial art forms is attributed to the Eastern practice of meditation and the system ofbreathingthat accompanies it. This is believed to empower an individual with the proper relaxation and focused abilities that allow for the proper channeling of strength, coupled with the accuracy and speed, needed to excel in any confrontational situation. In addition, the increased medical knowledge allowed for the identification of those body areas that would sustain the most damage from the punishing strikes perfected through the art of mediation. While martial arts styles are typically classified as hard or soft, both techniques incorporate a small measure of the other.</p>
<p>Before detailing the differences of each style, the following example taken form the animal kingdom might illustrate the contrast between the two opposing styles. Picture a confrontation between a mongoose and a snake. The mongoose jumps quickly from spot to spot, radiating energy as it tests the defenses of the snake with lightning attacks and retreats. The mongoose is clearly displaying the hardstyle.The snake, on the other hand, waits patiently, giving no indication of when or where it is to strike. It simply sways back and forth before its sudden unexpected attack. This is the essence of the soft style. The differences are further detailed below.</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_2.1.0.0.1">2.1.0.0.1</a> Hard Martia Arts Styles</h5>
<p>Hard arts typify force opposed by force. In unarmed combat, this force is accomplished by propelling the entire body, or part of it, against the opponent, since added momentum is gained by sending the weight and motion of the entire body after a punch or kick? Various strikes are leveled at the opponent, but the most effective are those whose forces are propelled in a straight line. Blocks that forcefully deflect or stop incoming blows often precede countermoves in a hard style, while the countermove itself rapidly follows the block with direct punches or kicks. This approach is very straightforward and is the basis for many martial arts styles, including karate, Korean tae kwon do, and the hard arts of Chinese kung fu.</p>
<p>To the trained martial artist, however, the hard style does present one flaw. Because of the muscular tension displayed and the momentum of their bodies, the stance of the martial artist can reveal their next intention to their opponent. In addition, while the breathing techniques of the hard arts (focusing breathing to a point between the solar plexus and the upper chest) allow the martial artist to focus his energy into explosive releases, there exists the danger of draining the user of strength. Therefore, in a clash between martial artists using hard styles, there is an emphasis on instinctive and trained reactions using physical strength to quickly end the conflict.</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_2.1.0.0.2">2.1.0.0.2</a> Soft Martial Arts Styles</h5>
<p>Circular motion is the forms the basis of the soft arts. Like the snake in the above example, a master of the soft arts is still and relaxed. Unlike the tensed muscles of those martial artists exercising the hard style, a master of the soft arts does not reveal his intentions. In addition, the soft arts masters also seek to use incoming force against itself, instead of opposing the force. For example, the bodily momentum initiated by a striking opponent could be further increased and used against him by simply stepping to one side and pushing the opponent towards the ground. In a clash between two martial artists using soft styles, the emphasis is on using the mind to outwit the opponent.</p>
<p>Correct breathing techniques are very important to the soft arts. Unlike the breathing employed in the hard arts, in the soft arts breathing is initiated low in the body, two inches below the navel, where the center of vital energy or chi is believed to reside. By training the mind to use the muscles of the diaphragm to draw air into ihe lungs in this manner, it is possible to evoke a tremendous force that radiates from within the body to the extremities, where it can be used to deliver punishing blows to opponents.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/2.2/THE DEVELOPMENT OF MARTIAL ARTS" -->
<h2><a name="MAC_2.2">2.2</a> THE DEVELOPMENT OF MARTIAL ARTS</h2>
<p>The next sections are devoted to the profiling the culture and fighting systems of many different countries of the world. These include Chinese martial arts, European martial arts, Japanese martial arts, Indian martial arts, Indonesian and Malaysian martial arts, Korean martial arts, and Okinawan martial arts. Each region has a brief history of each region and how martial arts developed in that region and interacted with the culture. If a martial arts system is further profiled later in this companion, it is distinguished by its name in bold-faced type,</p>
<p>It is important to realize that martial arts arose in a time when present-day nations were nothing more than mere assortments of independent states or clans, and warfare was small and localized, so that individual fighters attained greater importance due to the small number of troops in conflict. Warfare was ritualized and in some cases settled by single combat. One need only consider the prestige and honor bestowed upon even a slave in Roman times for his expertise as a gladiator to comprehend the allure of this ancient fighting art form.</p>
<p>In the following section, note that the Asian-inspired martial arts are grouped alphabetically by region, whereas the European-inspired martial arts are listed in chronological order.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/2.2.1/ASIAN MARTIAL ARTS" -->
<h3><a name="MAC_2.2.1">2.2.1</a> ASIAN MARTIAL ARTS</h3>
<p>This is a brief discussion of the history of Asian martial arts.</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_2.2.1.0.1">2.2.1.0.1</a> Chinese Martial Arts</h5>
<p>The great Songshan ShaoJin Temple and monastery at the foot of the Songshan Mountains of Central China is the place where Chinese martial arts are believed to have taken root. Although there exists scholarly doubt about the accuracy of this legend, it is widespread among the martial arts community. It is believed that an Indian monk by the name of Bodhidharma arrived to teach the Chinese a new approach to Buddhism that involved intense long periods of meditation, from which the meditative schools of <strong>Ch'an in China</strong> and <strong>Zen in Japan</strong> are said to have arisen. One commonly cited story asserts that Bodhidharma stared at the wall of a cave for nine consecutive years. To help the monks of the Temple withstand the long hours of meditation, Bodhidharma taught them exercises and movements to strengthen their bodies, and the Shaolin Temple Boxing technique was born.</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_2.2.1.0.2">2.2.1.0.2</a> The Shaolin Tradition and the Rise of Secret Societies</h5>
<p>At the height of its prosperity, the Shaolin Temple had 1,500 monks, 500 of who were fighting monks. They led simple lives, supporting themselves by farming the land they owned. It wasn't until 1674, after 128 of these monks assisted the Ch'ing Emperor in battle, that their highly effective fighting techniques were seen as cause for alarm. This was further heightened when they rejected the titles offered to them by the Emperor in favor of returning to their temple. The Emperor became persuaded that it was dangerous to let such an effective fighting force exist in the center of his empire that he did not fully control. Shortly thereafter, an army led by a renegade Shaolin monk surrounded the temple and burnt it to the ground. It is believe that five of the surviving monks subsequently founded China's infamous secret societies known as the <strong>Triads</strong>. Thereafter, martial arts became linked with Chinese secret societies.</p>
<p>The first of these to materialize were the White Lotus and White Lily societies. Each society was associated with a specific style of martial arts and would often practice at night during its secret meetings. Like the various secret societies formed afterwards, these two societies were instrumental in helping various factions rise to power, only to be ruthlessly suppressed by the same faction they supported. This antagonistic relationship dotted China's history with ever-changing dynasties in power, since the Chinese government wavered between embracing the advantage of having a large group of highly skilled fighting men in times of need and then feeling the need to suppress the same fighters to guard its power. The preferred martial arts style adopted by these fighters evolved from the Shaolin boxing and is known as the Shaolin kung fu tradition.</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_2.2.1.0.3">2.2.1.0.3</a> Kung Fu</h5>
<p>The Shaolin kung fu tradition is divided into two schools, northern and southern. While the two traditions might have evolved from separate schools, most Chinese attribute geography for the manifestation of the northern and southern kung fu styles. Northern China consists mainly of open plains where walking or riding great distances was customary, so that individuals' already developed legs became their main means of attack and defense. Southern China, on the other hand, is riddled with large numbers of waterways, requiring adept rowing and poling skills, which led to greater arm strength. As a result, the southern styles relied on the fists as the main means of attack. The main differences between the northern and southern schools of kung fu will be discussed below, as well as some of the techniques that arose form each school.</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_2.2.1.0.4">2.2.1.0.4</a> Northern Kung Fu Style</h5>
<p>Graceful and smooth movements are characteristic of the northern style of kung fu. In fact, the northern styles provide much of the basis for the martial arts styles used in Peking Opera. Stances are usually very wide and open, and arms are usually fully extended on both attack and defense, Leaps, turns and other sweeping movements are also incorporated in to this style. Movements displayed by animals have influenced the development of certain styles in this school and include: Crane, Dragon, Eagle, Horse, Praying Mantis, and Wing Chun styles among others.</p>
<p>One of the most striking characteristics of the northern styles is their emphasis on kicking. Northern stylists are trained to jump high and deliver one, two, or three kicks to an opponent before landing. Flying sidekicks are also taught, although their original use was to dismount cavalry. Northern styles use long formal sequences of attacks and counters as training aids that cover a wide area of ground. While some locks and grapples are used, most northern styles use strikes and kicks with the arms or legs fully extended. Weapons are also used and include swords, spears, staffs, scimitars, halberds, and war-fans. The forms used with weapon practice are open and graceful, but still effective.</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_2.2.1.0.5">2.2.1.0.5</a> Southern Kung Fu Styles</h5>
<p>Maintaining a solid stance and balance is of the utmost importance in the southern style. Like the northern schools, the southern schools also looked to the animal kingdom for inspiration. The southern school, however, developed styles based on the animals' sudden and overpowering attack movements and these include: the Cobra, Monkey, Leopard, Snake, and Tiger styles among others.</p>
<p>Southern-styles fighting are usually done in close quarters and consist of rapid, sequential punches, low kicks, and blocks. There is lighting-speed reaction and action, with great emphasis placed on simultaneous attack and defense. For example, while the left arm may block a punch, the right will slide into the opponent guard and attempt to deliver a blow to the face or chest. The essence of southern-style kung fu lies in the ability to instinctively attack and shower an opponent with blows while avoiding an opponent to grab any limbs. Southern martial artists believe that the speed and power of their attacks will defeat any foe.</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_2.2.1.0.6">2.2.1.0.6</a> Lion Dances</h5>
<p>Another unique characteristic of Chinese martial arts schools is the role of the lion dance. The lion is comprised of a highly decorated, stylized lion mask "head" made of paper-mache and a long silk "body" that conceals a second person who helps maneuver the lion. The wearer of the lion mask must be a member of a kung fu school. There are two kinds of lion heads, the young or black lion and the old or multi-colored lion. If a school displays the young lion, it is considered a form of hostility or insult to the other schools of the area.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the lion represents the soul of the kung fu school. During festivals and holidays, the lions from the various schools of the area roam the streets. The lions are tested by various challenges, such as the ability to maneuver past obstacles without breaking the team of the head and body. The performance of the lion serves to reflect the reputation of the school.</p>

<h3><a name="MAC_2.2.2">2.2.2</a> INDIAN MARTAIL ARTS</h3>
<p>India has always had a rich history of martial arts and warfare. Like early China, India was separated into many small warring kingdoms. Warfare remained on a small scale with ritualized combat between forces. There does not appear to be a large degree of military specialization like that found in China. Rather the martial arts were taught as part of the complete training for the accomplished noble. India has always had a rich history of individual self-development. One of the most important influences of India was the promulgation of the religion of Buddhism. Buddhism while an important religion in India never achieved the overall influence it gained after it was introduced in China.</p>
<p>Indian martial arts showcase some unique fighting tactics. In silambam, or stick fighting, the attacker will strike the ground first before attacking his opponent. This allows the strike to enter from below as well as confuses the opponent. Single and paired stick forms are studied as well.</p>
<p>Other unique weapons taught in Indian martial arts are the bundi dagger, a grooved double-edged blade; three-directional knives, very useful for blocking attacks and efficient at slashing attacks; and the urumi or spring sword, kept coiled up and when released it is whipped through the air to produce extraordinary noise, dust, and sparks.</p>
<p>The martial art of Kalaripayit was first developed in India. It is a true unarmed combat system that emphasizes evasion of blows followed by hand or foot attacks. The blocks used in this style are mainly circular, seeking to deflect a blow to the side rather than stop it strength to strength. Like Chinese martial arts, the terrain where this art was practiced had a great influence on its form. The kicks used in this style vary depending on whether the Northern or Southern forms are followed. The kicks taught in the Southern style are low and delivered to the front of the body, while in the Northern style the kicks are very high and are often accompanied by acrobatic leaping attacks. In both styles, a great emphasis is placed on evading blows rather than blocking and coming from low stances into kicking or punching attacks. The origin for the difference in styles comes primarily from the terrain. The southern portion of India is hilly and has uncertain footing so attacks involving high leaps and kicks are not pursued because of the danger of losing one's balance. While in northern India, the ground is more level and firm and as a result the more acrobatic attacks could be used without a great fear of losing one's balance.</p>
<p>In fact, many forms taught to students involve movements that begin as a crouch, progress into a leap or a twist, and then end in a crouch that mimics evading a blow, leaping to attack and then evading another blow. A sophisticated system of grappling is taught in both styles, which involves locks, throws, and nerve points. The study of nerve points is called marma-adi and is regarded as a secret art taught only to masters.</p>

<h3><a name="MAC_2.2.3">2.2.3</a> INDONESIAN AND MALAYSIAN MARTIAL ARTS</h3>
<p>The region of Indonesia and Malaysia is home to many different types ofcombat systems. For example, Indonesia's three thousand islands are spread across three thousand miles of ocean encompassing many different kinds of weapon systems &mdash; from the Balak of Sumatra's expertise with (he blowpipe to the Sea Dayaks of Boreno use of the mandau (long knife).</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_2.2.3.0.1">2.2.3.0.1</a> The Kris</h5>
<p>The kris is considered to be the national weapon of both Indonesia and Malaysia, It is a double-edged dagger a length of 12 to 16 inches. The blade may be either wavy or straight (with wavy blades being more common). For a full description and combat tables, see <a href="#MAC_13.0">Sections 13.0</a> and <a href="#MAC_18.0">18.0</a>, This weapon is associated with many myths and legends in both cultures. It is said thai given the proper incantation water can be drawn from the weapon. A kris is said to be able to kill a designated victim by simply pointing at him. Stories are also told of a kris jumping out of its sheath to protect its owner or raiding within its sheath lo warn of danger. The incredible feats associated with the kris are attributed to the supernatural power of the weapon. Each kris is connected to its true owner from the time of the forging of the blade. The tuju (kris sorcery) also allowed the owner to kill a man by stabbing his shadow or his footprints. It has also been said that the kris can control fire by influencing its direction of motion.</p>
<p>All the magical properties attributed to the kris are to be used only in true need and never for display. The selection of a kris is a time-consuming and deliberate action. The fame of the maker of the kris, the pattern of the blade, the number of times Ihe blade has shed blood, and other marks help the prospective owner determine if the blade is right for him.</p>
<p>The kris occupies a central portion in the cultures of this region. In Java during the nineteenth century, criminals were executed by kris and the wearing of the kris was considered a mark of social distinction.</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_2.2.3.0.2">2.2.3.0.2</a> Other Weapons</h5>
<p>Similar to the myths and legends associated with the kris are also stories of the mystical power of the spear. Legends speak of a spear chasing a band of enemies for three miles and killing all but one of them. The Sea Dayak of Borneo wields Ihe mandau, a long single-edged blade similar to the machete. The handle of this weapon was usually adorned with human hair. The scabbard of this blade is brightly colored and is usually also adorned with human or animal hair or teeth.</p>
<p>Missile weapons used in this region revolve around the use of the blowpipe and the bow and arrow. The blowpipe is a common weapon in Java, Sumatra, the Celebes, and Borneo? What made the blowpipe such a dangerous weapon was the poison on the tips of the small missiles. This poison was usually derived from a species of stingray native to the waters of this region.</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_2.2.3.0.3">2.2.3.0.3</a> Pentjak-Silat</h5>
<p>The national form of defense of Indonesia is pentjak-silat. This combat system appears to have first developed in the Sumatran Minangkabau kingdom in Indonesia. Over the following centuries it spread to the rest of the island of Indonesia. Some scholars say that the inspiration for pentjak-silat is due to the Chinese martial arts that strongly mimicked animal attacks. Local legend says that a peasant woman first discovered this combat system when she watched a tiger and large bird fight to the death.</p>
<p>The word pentjak means "a system of self-defense" and silat as "fencing, to fend off. " Pentjak is practiced alone or with a training partner in a carefully controlled exercise, not unlike the Japanese kata forms. An unusual feature of this training exercise is that the use of percussive instruments as background music and training aids are frequently used. This can help the new student learn his timing and focus in this martial art. Silat can also be practiced separately, but it is most commonly practiced against a partner. There are over 150 recorded slyles of penljak-silal. Almost all the penljak-silat techniques operate on a responsive and adaptive style of fighting. The movements of this system are based on the movements of animals or people. These styles make no use of warming up or preparatory exercises because it recognizes that in combat a person will have no time for these types of exercises.</p>

<h3><a name="MAC_2.2.4">2.2.4</a> JAPANESE MARTIAL ARTS</h3>
<p>This is a brief overview of Japanese martial arts.</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_2.2.4.0.1">2.2.4.0.1</a> The Bugei and Ryu</h5>
<p>Like China, Japan possesses a long history of martial arts tradition. The bugei or martial arts were founded and taught by family organizations called ryu and later by non-bloodline organizations called ryu-ha. Each ryu or ryu-ha had its own unique perspective on the bugei it taught. Scholars have calculated that at one point in history over seven thousand unique ryu and ryu-ha schools existed in Japan. One of the most important ryus in Japanese history is the Tenshin Shoden Katori Shinto ryu. The founder of this ryu, lizasa Choisai lenao Scnsei, was born in 1387 in Chiba Prefecture, forty miles from present-day Tokyo. As a young man he became a skilled fighter and served as a retainer to the Chiba family. He took part in many battles and saw the destruction of numerous family lines. When Chiba fell, he retreated to seclusion in the Katori Shrine at the age of 60, where he engaged in daily worship and martial arts training. After a period of one thousand days, Choisai founded the teachings that became known as Tenshin Shoden Katori Shinto Ryu. The prefix "tenshin shoden" means heavenly, true correct tradition and was used because Choisai Sensei believed he had assembled the correct and true teachings. He lived until he was 102 years old and left behind a great body of martial arts and philosophical teachings that were deeply rooted in Zen philosophy. These teachings, in turn, were avidly followed by Japanese professional warriors known as bushi. After the Muromachi period (1392-1573), these warriors were referred to by a more commonly known name: samurai.</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_2.2.4.0.2">2.2.4.0.2</a> The Influence of Zen on the Bushi/Samurai</h5>
<p>The feudal Japanese warrior presented a fierce sight. He approached battle with an immovable will and a desire for displaying his combat skills to win personal glory and provehisloyaltytohismaster.WhiletraditionalBuddhism is generally based on compassion and gentleness, bushi were militant warriors. <em>Zen</em>, however, was one of the less militant sects of Buddhism in feudal Japan that survived because most of the bushi followed its teachings? The noted Japanese scholar, D. T. Suzaki, offers this insight:</p>
<p>In Japan, Zen was intimately related from the beginning of its history to the life of the samurai. Although it has never actively incited them to carry on their violent profession, it passively sustained them when they have for whatever reason entered into it. Zen has sustained them in two ways, morally and philosophically. Morally, because Zen is a religion that teaches us to not look backward once the course is decided upon; philosophically, because it treats life and death indifferently.</p>
<p>Zen taught the bushi to become self-reliant, self-denying, and above all, single-minded to the degree that no attachments or fears could sway them from their course. Zen also contributed to the development of the bushi with its concept of mushin no shin or "mind of no-mind "By entering into this state of meditative awareness, the bushi could react without any conscious thought to danger. The concepts of implicit trust in fate, submission to the inevitable and composure in the face of adversity were well ingrained in the bushi. Another factor that heavily influenced the acts of the bushi was the concept of bushido, the way of the warrior?</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_2.2.4.0.3">2.2.4.0.3</a> Bushido</h5>
<p>Bushido was developed after centuries of military experience and philosophical influence from other Asian countries. It was never developed as an explicit written code but rather, was communicated directly from leader to follower. Bushido incorporated Confucian ideas such as ancestor respect and filial piety. Furthermore, the rise ofthe military brought the idea of a bond of loyalty based on honor rather than kinship. A true follower of bushido was said to possess these seven virtues: justice, courage, benevolence, politeness, veracity, honor, and loyalty. It's interesting to note Chat amongst all this tradition, superstition managed to play a role in the life of the bushi. This was based on the nine signs or kuji no in.</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_2.2.4.0.4">2.2.4.0.4</a> Kujino In</h5>
<p>The nine signs or kuji no in is a practice of a Buddhist sect followed by many Japanese martial artists. Each sign has a name and each corresponds to a special meaning. By making the hand gestures of the nine signs followed by a secret tenth movement, a warrior was said to gain good fortune. The sign name and the corresponding meaning follow.</p>
<table summary="" >

<p>To be effective in battle, however, the Japanese warrior could not leave everything to fate. While the nine signs might have been practiced by all bushi, it was the extensive and rigorous training in martial arts or bugei that helped them attain both personal glory the handsome monetary rewards for services rendered. Before listing the bugei that bushi engaged in, it is important to distinguish the bugei, which are martial arts initiated in tenth century Japan, from the budo or martial ways that were developed in twentieth century Japan,</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_2.2.4.0.5">2.2.4.0.5</a> Bugei Versus Budo</h5>
<p>The bugei include the jutsu forms as well as other combat systems. The bugei were developed for maximal effectiveness in a combat situation. The budo, which includes the do forms, such as kendo, judo, karate-do, and iai-do, were developed from the existing bugei and are more concerned with attaining spiritual discipline through which individuals can attain self-perfection. Budo are less combat-oriented and lack the practical aspect of their predecessors. In some cases, the budo have deviated so far from their origins to have almost no value in a combat situation. Unlike budo, however, the bugei are intensely combat-driven fighting systems and include the following:</p>

</table>
<p>Of all the fighting systems incorporated under bugei, the two most important ones to master were ken-jutsu and iai-jutsu. The reason was the Japanese sword was the mostimportant weapon for any warrior to master.</p>
<h5>The Japanese Sword</h5>
<p>The bushi carried two blades, the o-dachi or long sword and the ko-dachi or short sword. The dimensions of the swords varied over Japanese history but some generalizations are possible. The long sword had a blade a little over two feet long and was generally a foot longer than the short sword. The blades were one and a quarter inches thick and tapered to a razor edge. The back of the blades sometimes contained a blood grove to make withdrawal from an enemy's body easier and to collect the blood on the blade. The types of swords most commonly associated with the bushi are the kaiana and wakizasha swords. These are grouped under the tachi swords and are known for their long blades and curved single-edged shape.</p>
<p>A great deal of ritual and customs dealt with the care and handling of these weapons. When confronted with a person with unknown intentions, the bushi kept his long sword close at hand. When kneeling in respect, if a warrior positioned his sword to the right he signaled noble intentions. If on the other hand, the sword was positioned on the left of the kneeling warrior, he signaled hostility or lack of trust of his host. In the house of a friend, the bushi might leave his long sword in the custody of a retainer but he would continue to carry his short sword. The host would keep his swords in easy reach at all times even in his own house. If a guest placed his sword with the handle facing his host, it was considered an insult against the skill of the host. To step over the sword of another as it lay on the ground was also considered to be an insult. The Japanese warrior considered the his sword to be his "soul." To touch or dishonor another's sword in any way was to invite a duel to the death.</p>
<p>The armor of the bushi was equally regarded, as it reflected his worth and prowess in battle; therefore, they were religiously maintained. The armor of the bushi was lightweight to provide the maximum amount of mobility and speed needed for combat. The armor was typically made of thin sheets of iron, hides, lacquered paper, cloth, and sharkskin. The armor covered the vital areas and was designed not to restrict his movement. Unlike European armor, bushi armor was not designed to withstand powerful direct strikes. Rather, it was designed to survive glancing blows and weak attacks. The breastplate was typically made of overlapping iron plates bound with metal clamps or silken cords. It was decorated with family crests and colors. The helmet of the bushi was a bowl-shaped device made of iron and secured to the head with silk cords. Notable bushi had ornate front pieces attached to their helmets signifying their clan or leadership. The shins were protected by flexible coverings, as were the arms. The body armor as a whole was usually decorated with a strong and impressive color scheme that usually had some significance to the house or clan the warrior was associated.</p>

<h3><a name="MAC_2.2.5">2.2.5</a> KOREAN MARTIAL ARTS</h3>
<p>Korea possesses a rich history of martial tradition. The Korean combat systems have traditionally favored empty-handed techniques and missile weapons. The reasons for this development are due to the heavy influence of calvary techniques that used the bow and the relatively late introduction of metallurgy techniques to Korea. Chinese cultural influence played a strong part in the development of Korea's unarmed combat systems. Korean philosophical thought also lead to the ideas that inspired the code of Bushido in Japan.</p>

<h3><a name="MAC_2.2.6">2.2.6</a> OKINAWAN MARTIAL ARTS</h3>
<p>Okinawa has always been a center for the exchange of ideas and trade between Japan and China, being situated just off the East China Sea and very close to Japan as well. In the late fifteenth century, a new king arose to power in Okinawa and banned the carrying of weapons by any one not associated with the government to quiet rebellion at the Start of his reign. This ban remained in force throughout most of Okinawa's history up to the nineteenth century? These restrictions lead to the development of karate, a rich martial art technique practiced by the native Okinawans. Many new types of weapons were pioneered by Okinawan martial artists due to the restrictions placed upon them, including the nunchaku, sai, kama, and tonfa.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/2.2.7/EUROPEAN MARTIAL ARTS" -->
<h3><a name="MAC_2.2.7">2.2.7</a> EUROPEAN MARTIAL ARTS</h3>
<p>Traditionally European fighting systems have been less well developed than their Asian counterparts. Where an Asian fighting system may be seen as a "way of life," the European fighting system is seen as a system of mechanical movements or simple recreation. In spite of this, Europe still has some interesting martial arts that have been developed in its rich history.</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_2.2.7.0.1">2.2.7.0.1</a> Early History</h5>
<p>The earliest martial disciplines developed in Europe were the events centered on the Greek festivals, the most famous of these being the Olympic games. Some of the events included javelin throwing, boxing, and wrestling? The pancratium was a contest that involved both wrestling and boxing and sometimes ended in the death of one of the combatants. In general these events were seen as public entertainment or a recreational sport, and were not considered to be true fighting systems.</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_2.2.7.0.2">2.2.7.0.2</a> The Middle Ages</h5>
<p>During the Middle Ages, a specialized class of warriors called the knights rose to prominence. The knight could be considered to he the European equivalent of the Asian martial artist. Medieval knights lived by a code in which skill at arms played a central part. Mounted fighting skills formed the core of chivalry. The budding knight primarily learned his skills from within the family. Young nobles practiced their fighting skills every day. The martial skills of the knight were displayed at the tourney. These tournaments could become very dangerous affairs often resulting in deaths.</p>
<p>Knights formed exclusive societies like the Knights Templar and the Knights of Malta. These groups of knights blended their martial skills with religious conviction, not unlike their counterparts in Asia.</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_2.2.7.0.3">2.2.7.0.3</a> The Renaissance</h5>
<p>A codified fighting system for European martial arts did not develop until the end of the Middle Ages and the start of the Renaissance. In the Renaissance era, armor became lighter and fighters began to rely on their skill and agility in combat. The nobles and the new middle class began to practice and learn (or be tutored) the art of self-defense and combat with the blade. The influx of the new middle class lead to the formation of fighting schools that taught them the skills needed for combat. The change from heavy armor cleaving weapons to lighter blades formulated fundamental changes in fighting strategy. The superiority of the point and quickness asserted itself and the art of fencing was born.</p>
<p>In European history there were many schools of fencing. The earliest and most famous schools came from Spain and Italy. The Italian schools of fencing attempted to simplify the cuts and thrusts of the blade. The Spanish schools of fencing mystified fencing through the inclusion of geometry and natural science. Because of their more practical bent, the Italian schools soon surpassed the Spanish schools of fencing.</p>
<p>The early teachers of fencing did not teach a codified method of fighting, but rather taught secret maneuvers and tricks that they had learned. Like other martial arts masters, the teachers of fencing were secretive, holding back their best tricks and maneuvers for their most worthy (or wealthy) students.</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_2.2.7.0.4">2.2.7.0.4</a> Unarmed Fighting Systems</h5>
<p>Unlike the unarmed fighting systems of the East, the unarmed fighting systems of Europe have been viewed more as sports than actual deadly fighting systems. Unlike the Eastern fighting styles, the European unarmed fighting systems have not been closely linked to medicine.</p>
<p>Savate or chausson was developed in France during the 19th century. Of all the European martial arts, savate bears the closest resemblance to the Asian fighting systems. It is believed to be developed from a folk combat art in which punching, kicking, and tripping were permitted. Despite its similarities, it has been confined to recreational uses and it has never been offered as a "way of life" to its practitioners. Savate also taught the use of the walking cane in its unarmed combat techniques.</p>

<h1><a name="MAC_3.0">3.0</a> FITTING MARTIAL ARTS INTO YOUR CAMPAIGN</h1>
<p>This section is meant to offer suggestions on how to incorporate martial arts into the campaign. Because the average martial arts specialist character can spend up to half his development points per level in refining his martial arts skills, it is important ensure the player will have ample opportunity for character development and role playing. Each player should have a share of the story and plot of the campaign. For a more in-depth discussion of campaign management and character development, the interested reader should refer to <a href="5521.html"><em>Gamemaster Law</em></a>.</p>
<p>All too often, the martial artist is relegated to the position of an outsider within the campaign structure since he usually comes from an exotic or distant culture. By definition an outsider is disconnected from the normal flow of events.This can make playing martial artists difficult when the campaign setting has a strong influence on the involvement of the players. These circumstances make it easy to fall into the role of observing the campaign rather than participating directly in it. The player of the martial artist should not need to totally rely on his character's combat skills as the only way to interact in the campaign. Some of the ideas and suggestions presented in this section offer ways for the Gamemaster to incorporate martial arts into his campaign without relegating the martial artist to the unenviable position of the outsider.</p>
<p>Sometimes Gamemasters ban martial arts from their campaigns because they simply do not have a good idea on how to integrate martial arts into their current campaign. <a href="#MAC_3.4">Section 3.4</a>, which details how to create new martial arts cultures, should give the overworked Gamemaster some ideas for creating new societies that support martial arts. <a href="#MAC_11.5">Section 11.5</a> on player concepts should also give the Gamemaster some story ideas and plot hooks that can be used to allow the martial arts character to be integrated with the current gaming group. There are some more general topics that concern the overall campaign theme and campaign metabolism that need to be addressed as well. This section will attempt to answer some of the complexities that arise when including martial arts into a current campaign setting.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/3.1/INTEGRATING INTO CURRENT CAMPAIGNS" -->
<h2><a name="MAC_3.1">3.1</a> INTEGRATING INTO CURRENT CAMPAIGNS</h2>
<p>Depending on the general campaign theme, the Gamemaster can incorporate martial arts in a variety of ways into the campaign. It can be very beneficial to have the martial artist integrated into the campaign in some other manner than fighting or hired muscle. Here are some common general campaign themes and ideas on how to incorporate martial arts into them.</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_3.1.0.0.1">3.1.0.0.1</a> Free-form Adventure Campaigns</h5>
<p>Free-form adventure campaigns are the most common type of campaign. In this type of campaign, player actions determine more of the plot than Gamemaster scheming. The Gamemaster tailors his campaign style to play to his player's desires and goals. In this type of campaign, martial arts can become an easy fit. The martial artist simply brings another set of skills to the player group that can help them accomplish their goals. Other than creating the cultural background for the martial artist (if none existed in the campaign before this), the Gamemaster does not have to do very much more than manage the group as before.</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_3.1.0.0.2">3.1.0.0.2</a> Mystery Campaigns</h5>
<p>Mystery campaigns are a little more rare than other types of campaigns as they require a significant amount of advance preparation by the Gamemaster to ensure that the campaign flows smoothly. In most cases, mystery campaigns revolve around many non-combat skills. This can put the dedicated martial artist at a disadvantage since he must spend more development points than most other types of characters to have effective combat skills. In the case of mystery campaigns, it is might be best to have the martial artist's homeland located fairly nearby. The reasoning behind this is that, in order for the martial artist to have equal story leverage with the other characters in the party, it will probably be necessary to have the martial artist's order or organization involved in the mystery to some degree. Another possible avenue is to have the martial artist have personal contacts with important figures in the involved mystery. Perhaps the martial artist once served as their bodyguard or taught them martial arts at some point in the campaign. In this way, the martial artist can use his contacts or his organization to help the party solve the mystery. In the case of the mystery campaign where the martial artist's order or organization plays a role, it is very important that the Gamemaster put a fair amount of time into creating the organization, culture, or order from which the martial artist learned his skills. It is not always necessary for the order or organization to be directly involved with the campaign-spanning mystery; they may only have a piece of the puzzle. For example, the martial artist's order or organization could simply point towards the involvement of another martial order or organization that is truly involved.</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_3.1.0.0.3">3.1.0.0.3</a> Political Campaigns</h5>
<p>Political campaigns are probably the rarest type of campaign as they take the most effort in terms of world creation and plotting on the part of the Gamemaster, Like mystery campaigns, political campaigns revolve around non-cornbat skills. Intrigue skills and role playing become important for every character whose player wishes to have the character fully involved in this aspect of the campaign, Many of the suggestions outlined for mystery campaigns can be followed for political campaigns. In some ways, a martial artist is out-of-place in political campaigns, since many political campaigns de-emphasize combat. Since a martial artist must spend a significant portion of his development points to keep his combat skills effective, it may be more appropriate to play another profession like a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Rogue">Rogue</a> or <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Thief">Thief</a>. However, with a little extra effort by the Gamemaster, this does not have to be the case. Again we turn to the order or organization that trained the martial artist, perhaps the martial artist can gain real power by challenging his superiors to ritual combat to take their position in the organization. By linking the martial artist with the political power of his organization, he can compete on an equal basis with the other players. Or perhaps the martial artist can serve as the bodyguard to a powerful NPC that can afford him access to the NPC's resources and backing. Perhaps the current campaign setting allows dueling and challenges and the martial artist is a feared duelist who is employed by other powerful organizations to further their own interests? The possibilities are endless if the Gamemaster and player should sit down before the start of the campaign and discuss how this character can fit into the overall campaign theme.</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_3.1.0.0.4">3.1.0.0.4</a> Quest Campaigns</h5>
<p>Quest campaigns are probably the most common campaign type encountered next to the Free-Form campaign. Quest campaigns have the benefit of focused structure and common goals. The martial artist's combat skills can be useful as the party attempts to overcome obstacles that hinder their success. It is also important to have the martial artist's culture or organization involved in the overall quest plotline. The martial artist's contacts and knowledge of his organization and culture should prove important to the eventual success of the party's quest. Some of the ideas listed in the mystery and political campaign types may prove useful in quest campaigns as well.</p>
<p>These suggestions are of course not only for martial artists. Other professions and character types should also be integrated into the campaign structure similarly.</p><!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/3.2/COMMON CHARACTER THEMES" -->
<h2><a name="MAC_3.2">3.2</a> COMMON CHARACTER THEMES</h2>
<p>When designing a campaign for the players it is important to carefully consider each player's goals and integrate these goals into the campaign structure. Ideally each player will have certain goals for his character that can tie in with other player goals to move the campaign forward with minimal effort by the Gamemaster.</p>
<p>There are several character themes that are particularly appropriate to martial artists. These themes would make good individual goals for martial artists within the campaign structure. Players are of course encouraged to make up their own individual goals whenever possible. <a href="#MAC_11.5">Section 11.5</a> on character concepts may offer some additional ideas for character goals.</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_3.2.0.0.1">3.2.0.0.1</a> Self-enlightenment</h5>
<p>A typical goal for a martial artist character is the goal of self-enlightenment and inner peace. The martial artist attempts to attain a tranquil state of mind where his actions flow without conscious direction. This state of mind leads to inner peace and tranquillity.</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_3.2.0.0.2">3.2.0.0.2</a> Self-mastery</h5>
<p>A related goal to self-enlightenment is the goal of self-mastery for martial artists. Self-mastery involves the martial artist controlling his body' s natural responses to threats and pain. The most important goal for a martial artist striving for self-mastery is the development of an iron will and determination that will allow him to achieve his goals.</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_3.2.0.0.3">3.2.0.0.3</a> Martial Prowess</h5>
<p>Another common goal for martial artist characters is the goal of martial prowess. The martial artist's goal is to become the most talented practitioner of his martial arts style or weapon style in the world. He wishes to meet and defeat all other martial arts masters of different schools and traditions to prove his mastery.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/3.3/CHALLENGES AND FINDING TEACHERS" -->
<h2><a name="MAC_3.3">3.3</a> CHALLENGES AND FINDING TEACHERS</h2>
<p>In a martial arts campaign, there should be plenty of opportunity for players to interact with local and foreign martial arts champions in contests and exhibitions. If the Gamemaster takes the time to develop some rivalries between martial arts schools and annual martial arts contests for insertion into the campaign, he will be rewarded well in terms of player feedback and participation.</p>
<p>Historically, challenges were a central part of a martial arts master's existence and could not be refused. The challenger could stipulate whether an armed or unarmed match was desired and the host had to accept. Further, the guest could decide whether the match would end in mere defeat or death? Although a master could not refuse a challenge, if the challenger was a stranger of unproved merit, he could be referred to a senior student. Often masters would do so for the opportunity to study the challenger's style and technique. The chief reasons for having senior students accept challenges from unknowns were to avoid fights with brash young inferior fighters. If such a challenger did fight the resident master and lost, he would often leave with a phrase such as "two years" or "five years"&mdash;indicating how long he would train before retuming for another bout. Due to the prevalence of challenges, many masters would keep the ultimate secrets of their martial arts to themselves for fear of being challenged by their own students.</p><p>Challenges can be inserted into the campaign to provide many plot lines and plot hooks for martial artists. Perhaps the characters are senior students of a respected master, and as a result are continuously challenged by local toughs who wish to improve their reputations. An interesting variant plot line would be having a character's teacher lose to an ill-mannered braggart. The master mysteriously became ill before the match, but decided to continue with the fight. His illness got worse during the match and he was defeated easily. The braggart then set about starting his own school and bad mouthing the character and his fellow students. The master's students might suspect foul play and investigate the situation on their own.</p><p>Annual contests are also a great source for campaign ideas and memorable moments. Perhaps the players wish to have their characters enter the famous martial arts tournament. Will they succeed and defeat all challengers or will they fail and bring shame to their school ? Some ofthe ideas in <a href="#MAC_14.7">Section 14.7</a>, which details cinematic combat, might be useful for staging ideas. Perhaps the contest is held on wooden scaffolding twenty feet above the ground so the spectators can see the combatants and the fighters are in constant danger of falling to the ground.</p>
<p>An interesting role playing option available to martial artists is the task of finding a master to teach them martial arts skills. The Gamemaster may make the players act out the process, or he may say that they find and establish a relationship with a teacher and take the role playing from there. The martial arts teacher can provide a great NPC for campaigns, not only as a source of training, but a source for the Gamemaster to introduce new plot lines.</p>
<p>Historically, one of the most difficult challenges facing a prospective student of a martial arts style was finding a master to accept him as a student. Most masters taught only a few students at a time, and those that accepted students usually taught very slowly. Usually, if a new student was accepted, he would be taught by to a senior student for years, until it was decided that he had learned enough to benefit from the master's instruction. Many masters followed the dictum, "never tell too plainly," when teaching their students. Often the concept they were trying to teach would be clouded in metaphor and double-meanings. There were several reasons behind this inefficient teaching style. Master's often followed traditional teaching methods, teaching their students as they were taught. A master could be hiding his lack of true knowledge of a style behind a cloak of secrecy and ill-defined techniques. The master might simplybe ill-natured or unwilling to teach his secrets to his students. Because many students ended up challenging their masters, this fear was not unwarranted. Many martial arts styles died with their final masters because of this need for secrecy,</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/3.4/CREATING CULTURES" -->
<h2><a name="MAC_3.4">3.4</a> CREATING CULTURES</h2>
<p>The Gamemaster is encouraged to create his own special cultures and societies for his campaign world that have their own unique martial arts. This section offers some examples for creating your own societies and how to model martial arts within them. For a more general discussion of how to create fantasy worlds and societies, refer to <a href="5521.html"><em>Gamemaster Law</em></a>. For more information on the historical development of martial arts and how martial arts interacted with the cultures in which they developed, please see <a href="#MAC_2.0">Section 2.0</a>.</p>
<p>When introducing martial artists into your campaign, it is necessary to decide where their skills originated if these skills are not normal to the current campaign setting. To make sure that the campaign feels authentic, it is necessary to develop some extra background for the campaign to explain the martial artist's place within it. Even if there is a pre-existing culture or society that will be a good fit, it is still recommended that the Gamemaster take time to answer the questions in this section.</p>
<p>The easiest way to determine how the martial arts interact with a new culture or society is to ask some simple questions, like the following.</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_3.4.0.0.1">3.4.0.0.1</a> What is the History of Martial Arts in this Culture?</h5>
<p>Does the culture or society have a rich heritage of martial arts? This question asks whether martial arts existed for most of the culture or society's existence ? Depending on the answer, the Gamemaster gains an immediate understanding of what level of martial arts might exist.</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_3.4.0.0.2">3.4.0.0.2</a> What group or organization was first involved in M.A. in this culture? Why were martial arts developed?</h5>
<p>Answering this question helps to cement the place of martial arts in a society. For example, martial arts could have been developed as a response to oppression from the ruling classes, or it could have developed after challenges and dueling became widespread in the society. Another possibility is that martial arts could have developed for another reason altogether (e.g., strengthening exercises) and later evolved into fighting arts.</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_3.4.0.0.3">3.4.0.0.3</a> What Martial Arts Skills are Taught in this Culture?</h5>
<p>What type of martial arts does this culture specialize in? This question asks whether the culture focuses on a specific type of martial arts. For example, a culture could focus more on martial arts involving weapons than unarmed combat, or the reverse.</p>
<p>Does this culture have knowledge of rare martial arts skills, like the Chi Powers skills, or other Restricted martial arts skills? It is suggested that one region not have access to all the martial arts skills in the campaign world, or if such a region does exist, that martial arts skills be taught in other regions and cultures as well. Following this suggestion offers a little more diversity and depth to the created society.</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_3.4.0.0.4">3.4.0.0.4</a> How are martial arts taught in this culture?</h5>
<p>This question really involves several decisions that must be answered before this question can be fully addressed. Are martial arts taught to everyone in the culture or are they taught to a subset of people in the culture? To pass the skills and knowledge necessary for the continued evolution of martial arts there must be some way to train other students who will later become masters. This training can follow many different avenues. The Gamemaster can decide that there exists one primary organization that trains most of the martial artists in the culture? Or the Gamemaster can decide that there are many independent organizations that train their members in the martial arts. It is even possible to say that the primary teaching method for martial arts revolves around individual teacher/student relationships.</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_3.4.0.0.5">3.4.0.0.5</a> What are unique features of this culture's knowledge of martial arts?</h5>
<p>Does this culture have knowledge of certain martial arts skills that are not readily available to other cultures and societies? For example, is this the only culture that has knowledge of Chi Powers skills ? Does this culture have a bias against certain types of skills? For example, the culture could have a bias against Maneuvering in Heavy Armor skills or Missile Weapon skills. Does this culture Specialize in certain types of martial arts skills? For example, a culture that specializes in Weapon Style skills could have their Basic Weapon Style skill style point range from 0 to 35 rather than the standard 0 to 30 style point range. For some examples where martial arts skills are specialized in specific cultures, see <a href="#MAC_16.1">Section 16.1</a>.</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_3.4.0.0.6">3.4.0.0.6</a> What Is the Place of Martial Arts in this culture?</h5>
<p>What is the place of martial arts in the culture? If the ruling class developed advanced martial arts skills, these skills will be most likely held in higher regard than if the common people (usually in response to oppression from the ruling class) developed the same skills.</p>
<p>Does this culture honor and recognize manial arts? This is an important question that helps to define the place of martial arts within the society. If most of the martial arts skills were developed by the ruling class, then it is more likely that martial arts will hold some position of honor and respect within the society. If most of the martial arts skills were developed by the general populace of the culture, then it may be likely that martial arts are suppressed as a challenge to the noble's power.</p>
<p>Depending on the culture's view of martial arts, what types of career paths are available to martial artists? Can a martial artist open his own school of martial arts and make a comfortable living? Can a martial artist make a living as an instructor and martial arts consultant? Must the martial artist always be working (as a bodyguard, warrior, etc.) to make a living?</p>
<p>What are the place of challenges and contests in this culture? If the society allows challenges to decide points of law or dispute, then the role of martial arts in the society becomes very important. Also if challenges are legal, then martial arts become a survival skill for the social class that is most involved in challenges. When the Gamemaster decides the place of challenges in the new culture, he should also think about any forms or conventions that are also associated with a challenge. Arc challenges only performed with certain weapons? Are there restrictions on who can challenge whom? When is a challenge illegal or unlawful?</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/3.5/POWER LEVELS" -->
<h2><a name="MAC_3.5">3.5</a> POWER LEVELES</h2>
<p>It is important for the Gamemasier to fully understand the power level of martial arts that he wishes to allow within his campaign. It is equally important that he convey his expectations of the capabilities of martial artists to his players so there is no chance for misunderstanding. With both the players and the Gamemaster starting from a common set of assumptions, a campaign becomes much more stable.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/3.5.1/CORE" -->
<h3><a name="MAC_3.5.1">3.5.1</a> CORE</h3>
<p>The Core power level assumes a near real-world expectation of martial arts. The martial arts are treated as unarmed combat with all the inherent advantages and disadvantage that come with that expectation. The Core power level is well integrated with the entire RMSS. The basic components of the Core power level are as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Adrenal Defense skill is redefined to require a 40% activity action in the round it is used;</li>
<li>New <span id="essence">Essence-based</span> and <span id="mentalism">Mentalism-based</span> Monk variant professions are introduced;</li>
<li>The new Martial Arts Combat Maneuvers skill category is added;</li>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/3.5.2/HEROIC" -->
<h3><a name="MAC_3.5.2">3.5.2</a> HEROIC</h3>
<p>The Heroic power level assumes a slightly larger-than life expectation of martial arts. The martial arts are treated as a little more effective than they actually are in the real world. The Heroic power level lets players accomplish extraordinary acts more easily. In most cases, the Heroic power level is the average level at which a role playing campaign is run. The basic components of the Heroic power level are as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>The inclusion of the new background options and talent and flaws;</li>
<li>The inclusion of the new training packages listed in this companion;</li>
<li>The special techniques associated with some martial arts styles and weapon styles may be used;</li>
<li>The optional rules listed as Heroic may be used if desired.</li>
</ul>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/3.5.3/FANTASTIC" -->
<h3><a name="MAC_3.5.3">3.5.3</a> FANTASTIC</h3>
<p>The Fantastic power level assumes an unrealistic expectation of martial arts. Martial arts are presented as the supreme form of combat and are practiced by the majority of the heroes of the campaign world. Martial arts masters can accomplish supernatural feats through the focus of their inner power. The basic components of the Fantastic power level are as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>The inclusion of Chi Powers skills, as described in <a href="#MAC_10.0">Section 10.0</a>;</li>
<li>The widespread use of the Cinematic Combat options, as described in <a href="#MAC_14.7">Section 14.7</a>;</li>
<li>Basic Weapon Style skills and Basic Martial Arts Styles skills are treated as Everyman skills for all professions;</li>
<li>Advanced Weapon Style skills and Advanced Martial Arts Styles skills are treated as non-Restricted skills for all professions;</li>
<li>The optional rules listed as Fantastic may be used if desired,</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to recognize that the Fantastic power level is the most potentially unbalancing option with respect to the rest ofthe <em>RMSS</em>. Inclusion ofthe options given for this power level will create some imbalances in the system as the role of martial arts skills achieves a greater prominence over other types of skills.</p>

This book introduces two variant <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Monk">Monk</a> professions&mdash;the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Taoist_Monk">Taoist monk</a> and the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Zen_Monk">Zen monk</a>. The concepts behind these two variant professions share some similarities with the original <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Monk">Monk</a> profession presented in <a href="5500.html"><em>RMSR</em></a>.</p>
<p>The original concept of the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Taoist_Monk">Taoist monk</a> springs from Chinese philosophical thought. Taoism provided great influence on the development of Chinese martial arts. The doctrine of Tao is one of naturalism. Taoism teaches that the only means of attaining a full life is through the observation of nature and living according to the ways of nature. In Taoism, nothing should be done contrary to the natural order of the world. There are also two supporting doctrines of Taoism, first stated by its founder Lao Tzu. The first doctrine is the concept of the "Uncarved Block. ? The "Uncarved Block" represents man in his original state of existence, unpolluted by concerns of the world or hatred. Taoism strives to return man to his unconditioned natural state. The other doctrine is the concept of non-action. Non-action does not imply doing nothing, rather it implies taking no action against natural law. This doctrine shows that force is futile in some circumstances and it is sometimes better to yield to strength than to be destroyed by striving against it. The Taoist monk profession deals more with the natural world and elemental forces than the original <a href="5500.html"><em>RMSR</em></a> <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Monk">Monk</a> profession. Many of the spells used in the base lists of this profession take their inspiration from the natural world.</p>
<p>The original concept of the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Zen_Monk">Zen monk</a> springs from Japanese philosophical thought. Meditative Buddhism or Zen provided a great influence on the development of Japanese martial arts. The doctrine of Zen teaches the practitioner to become self-reliant, self-denying, and above all to be single-minded to such a degree that no attachments or fears couid sway him from his course, Zen also introduced the concept ofmushin no shin or "mind of no-mind." Also important to the concept of the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Zen_Monk">Zen monk</a> is the tradition of Shingon Buddhism in Japanese society that uses mystical incantations and practices to accomplish incredible feats. It is the attributed powers of this obscure and secretive sect of Buddhism that provides much of the inspiration for the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Zen_Monk">Zen monk's</a> base lists.</p>
<p>It is possible to have all three professions within a campaign; each profession has its own unique focus and approach to the martial arts and life that should make them easily distinguishable. The original <em>RMSS</em> <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Monk">Monk</a> profession remains the most flexible of the three professions. The <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Taoist_Monk">Taoist monk</a> profession focuses more on the elements and the natural world. The Taoist monk can also create mystical effects that can not be attributed solely to self-discipline or willpower. The <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Zen_Monk">Zen monk</a> profession focuses on mental discipline and willpower that allows the user to transcend the limitations of his body and influence the perceptions of others.</p>

<h1><a name="MAC_7.0">7.0</a> SKILLS</h1>
<p>The new and revised martial arts skills form the foundation of this companion. It is important that the Gamemaster gain a firm understanding of the contents of this section, as these skills will change the skill selection strategy of players who wish to develop characters proficient in the martial arts.</p>
<p>Between the first and second printing of <a href="5500.html"><em>RMSR</em></a>, there was an important change in the definition of Everyman, Occupational, and Restricted skills. For those readers that do not have the second printing, the changes are briefly summarized below:</p>
<p>In the <em>RMSS</em>, skills are classified as Normal, Everyman, Occupational, or Restricted. Normal skills are developed per the standard rules outlined in RMSS, Each rank purchased with development points by the character translates to a single new rank in the skill. Everyman, Occupational, and Restricted skills are handled differently. For Everyman skills, each rank developed in that skill actually results in two skill ranks. For Occupational skills, each rank developed in that skill actually results in three skill ranks. For skills classified as Restricted, every two ranks developed in that skill actually results in a single skill rank. Note that developed skill ranks are those "purchased" with development points (i.e., not gained through training packages, adolescence, etc.).</p><!-- AppleSegEnd -->

<p><strong>Classification:</strong> Static Maneuver, Special, and OB</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_7.2.0.0.1">7.2.0.0.1</a> Blind Fighting</h5>
<p>The Blind Fighting skill allows its practitioner to overcome some of the penalties associated with not being able to see one's opponent. This skill trains the practitioner to use senses other than sight during combat. Normally a character will have at least a -100 modifier to his OB if he is fighting an opponent he cannot see. A successful Blind Fighting static maneuver can be used to offset the OB penalty for not being able to see one's opponent. To determine the effect of such an attempt, roll (open-ended) and add the Blind Fighting skill bonus. Then refer to the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#MAC_T-4.1">Maneuver/Movement Table (T-4.1)</a> using the "Extremely Hard" column. If the result is a number, that number is used to offset the current penalty for vision. Successful use of this skill will never increase the wielder's OB; it can only offset penalties due to not being able to see one's opponent, A failure result when attempting this skill will result in the character not being able to take any action this round. An extraordinary success when attempting this skill will allow the character to completely offset the penally for not being able to see his opponent. (SD)</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_7.2.0.0.2">7.2.0.0.2</a> Missile Deflecting</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for using the body or a weapon or a shield to deflect or even catch a thrown weapon or missile directed at the user. To determine the effect of such an attempt, roll (open-ended) and add the Missile Deflecting skill bonus. Then refer to the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#MAC_T-4.1">Maneuver/Movement Table (T-4.1)</a> using the "Extremely Hard" column against thrown weapons or the "Sheer Folly" column against missile weapons. If the result is a number, it is subtracted from the weapon's attack roll (in addition to the normal DB). If the missile or thrown object misses, the character has a chance of catching the item. Roll d100 (open-ended) and add the modification received earlier from the Movement/Maneuver Table; if the result is over 100, the item has been caught; if desired. The Missile Deflecting skill requires a 100% activity action. The roll is modified by -20 for each additional missile that the character wishes to try to deflect that round. Resolve each missile attack separately. {SD}</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_7.2.0.0.3">7.2.0.0.3</a> Tumbling Evasion</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for evading attacks by using tumbling maneuvers. The skill rank (not the skill rank bonus) is added to the tumbler's DB for all other attacks. The Tumbling Evasion maneuver is resolved during the round it is actively used and it requires a 60% activity action. {Ag}</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_7.2.0.0.4">7.2.0.0.4</a> Two-Weapon Fighting</h5>
<p>This skill allows a combatant to fight with two weaponssimultaneously. He is allowed to make two weapon attacks for each melee attack action, and may engage two opponents providing neither opponent is receiving any positional combat modifiers for their OB (e.g., if either opponent is receiving a +15 bonus for Flank Attack or a +20 bonus for Rear Attack the attacker would not be able to strike both opponents in thesame round).</p>
<p>Two Weapon Fighting skills must be developed for each two-weapon combination (e.g., shortsword/handaxe, rapier/dagger, etc.). The OB for each weapon attack is equal to the skill bonus for the Two-Weapon Fighting skill for the combination of those two weapons or one of the individual weapon OBs, whichever is the lesser bonus.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Against 1 Opponent:</strong> There is no negative attack modification against one opponent.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Against 2 Opponents:</strong> There is a -20 modification to both attacks.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Parrying or Special Attacks:</strong> The user must reduce both weapon OBs by the same amount (i.e., the amount of his parry or special attack). Against one opponent, the user increases his DB by the amount of his parry. Against two opponents, the amount of his parry must be split between the two opponents as the user sees fit.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Using the off-hand:</strong> The two-weapon combination is developed for a specific weapon and hand combination. For example, a Rogue trained in a rapier/dagger combination might have decided to use the rapier left-handed and ihe dagger in his right. Switching either weapon to the other hand incurs the normal -20 penalty for using the off-hand for each weapon.</blockquote>

Roll d100 (open-ended) and add the modification received earlier fromthe Movement/Maneuver table; if the result is over 100. the item has been caught; if desired.

<h5><a name="MAC_7.5.0.0.3">7.5.0.0.3</a> Blind Fighting</h5>
<p>This skill trains the practitioner to use senses other than sight during combat. Normally a character will have at least a -100 modifier to his OB if he is fighting an opponent he can not see, A successful Blind Fighting static maneuver can be used lo offset the OB penalty for not being able to see one's opponent. To determine the effect of such an attempt, roll (open-ended) and add the Blind Fighting skill bonus. Then refer to the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#MAC_T-4.1">Maneuver/Movement Table (T-4,1)</a> using the "Extremely Hard" column. If the result is a number, that number is used to offset the current penalty for vision. Successful use of this skill will never increase the wielder's OB, it can only offset penalties due to not being able to see one's opponent. A failure result when attempting this skill will result in the character not being able to take any action this round.

<h5><a name="MAC_7.8.0.0.1">7.8.0.0.1</a> Disarm Foe (Armed)</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus to remove a foe's weapon with your weapon. If the disarming skill check is successful, the opponent will drop his weapon. Depending on how successful the character is in his disarming attempt, the Gamemaster may decide to let the player decide where the disarmed weapon will go. To determine the success of the disarming attempt, make a static maneuver and add the character's skill bonus. The opponent's total usable OB (e,g., his OB before delegating parry or special attacks) with his weapon is taken as a negative modifier to the static maneuver. There are four separate skills for the user to develop, representing weapon categories against which a character can be trained: 1-Handed, 2-Handed, Pole Arm, and Two-Weapon Combination. {Ag}</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_7.8.0.0.2">7.8.0.0.2</a> Disarm Foe (Unarmed)</h5>

<h5><a name="MAC_7.8.0.0.3">7.8.0.0.3</a> Feint (Armed)</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus to trick your opponent to react to a false melee attack and weaken his defenses. A successful feint maneuver may result in a temporary reduction in the total DB of the target. To determine the success of the feint attempt, take the amount of the character's Feint skill bonus committed to the attack and make a static maneuver roll. The opponent's total usable OB (e.g., his OB before delegating parry or special attacks) is subtracted from this roll. Then refer to the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#MAC_T-4.1">Maneuver/Movement Table T-4.1</a>, in <a href="5500.html"><em>Rolemaster Standard Rules</em></a>, using the "Extremely Hard" column. If the result is a number, this number is subtracted from the target's normal DB.</p>
<p>A Feint maneuver may negate some or all of a target's DB due to shield bonus (including magical shields), parrying actions, skills that increase the DB of the target, or the target's Quickness modifier. Any positional DB or inherent DB of a target will not be reduced by a Feint maneuver. Examples of positional DB are fighting from higher ground or being behind some sort of cover. An inherent DB could be general magical protection or high quality armor, both of which cannot be affected by a feigned attack.</p>
<p>If the Feint maneuver is successful, half of the OB committed for the feint is regained for the normal melee attack. If the feint fails, all OB shifted to the feinting maneuver is lost for this round. However, the player must still make his attack action. {Qu}</p>
<p>If the character develops <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Situational_Awareness">Situational Awareness: Feinting</a>, he may apply this skill bonus against Feinting attacks made against him in addition to any other modifiers.</p>

<p>If the character develops <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Situational_Awareness">Situational Awareness: Feinting</a>, he may apply this skill bonus against Feinting attacks made against him in addition to any other modifiers.</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_7.8.0.0.1">7.8.0.0.1</a> Racial Attacks</h5>
<p>This skill provides a bonus to use a natural weapon attack available to the character. The bonus of this skill is treated in all ways like a normal OB for purposes of attacking, parrying, using other special attacks, etc. Examples of natural weapon attack are horn attacks, claw attacks, tail lashes, or even biting attacks. Generally, all races with a special racial attack may learn this skill as an Everyman skill regardless of profession. The relative strength and effectiveness of each racial attack will vary by race and must be determined by the Gamemaster. See <a href="#MAC_8.0">Sections 8.0</a> and <a href="#MAC_9.0">9.0</a> for more details on how to integrate racial attacks into weapon styles and martial arts styles.</p>

<h5><a name="MAC_7.9.0.0.1">7.9.0.0.1</a> Adrenal Defense</h5>
<p>The Adrenal Defense skill allows the user to avoid attacks with missile or melee weapons during combat. The skill bonus ofthe defender is added to his DB versus melee attacks. Against missile attacks the skill bonus is halved and added to his DB. To use Adrenal Defense, an individual must be aware that he is under attack. In addition, the character must not be wearing armor and can not have a shield or large object in his hands. To represent the division of concentration necessary to avoid multiple attacks targeted at the user in the same round, Adrenal Defense requires 40% activity action in the combat round. {None}</p>
<p>This Adrenal Defense activity does count as one of the three allowable actions in a tactical round (this restriction may be negated by using the proper Weapon Style or Martial Arts Style skill). The 40% activity required for Adrenal Defense does apply against the 100% activity limit for the round (this restriction may be lessened by using the proper Weapon Style or Martial Arts Style skill).</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_7.9.0.0.2">7.9.0.0.2</a> Adrenal Resistance</h5>
<p>The Adrenal Resistance skill enhances a character's inner strength to resist negative modifiers due to pain or wounds. To determine the penalty that can be offset, make an open-ended roll, adding this skill bonus, and all other applicable modifiers. Take the resulting number and refer to the "Extremely Hard" column of the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#MAC_T-4.1">Maneuver/Movement Table T-4.1</a>, in <em>Rolemaster Standard Rules</em>. If the result is a number, it can be used to reduce any negative modifiers due to the pain from concussion hit loss or wounds by the amount shown. This skill requires a 20% preparation action in the round it is attempted, and the effects last up to an entire hour. Note that the Gamemaster may decide in the case of using this skill to resist pain from extremely serious wounds that there may be a risk of further aggravating the injury. {None}</p>
<p>This skill requires a 10% activity action each round it is used, regardless of the amount of negative modifiers from wounds offset. The Adrenal Resistance activity does not count against the three-action limit in a tactical round. The 10% activity action required for this skill does apply against the 100% activity limit for a given round.</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_7.9.0.0.3">7.9.0.0.3</a> Adrenal Touchness</h5>
<p>The Adrenal Toughness skill allows the user to toughen his body to withstand blows that would otherwise inflict damage. This skill requires taking a 20% preparation action in the round immediately prior to the use of this skill (or during the snap action phase of the same round). Then the character must make a static maneuver modified by the skill bonus. If successful, the individual may reduce the severity of any critical by one during the next round or the remainder of the current round. (In the case of an 'A' critical, the critical is modified by -20). In addition, any Self-inflicted critical stemming from the individual striking a surface or object with his hand or foot is nullified completely. {None}</p>

<blockquote><p>Nothing broke the silence except the hissing of blades and the sharp exhalation of breath as the pack of thugs circled their prey warily. The old swordsman held his blade aloft as he stood his ground before his numerous adversaries. He moved in a slowly turning circle, keeping his foes from attacking directly at his back, and he rotated his blade through the seven positions of guard. The young toughs were armed with a variety of weapons from awards to clubs to chains, and several suffered in silence the pain from their wounds that were inflicted when they had first rushed the old man.</p>
<p>The crash of arms echoed once again down the deserted street and the faint sound of the city guard's alarm could be heard approaching. The city guard would be here soon. The old man's face remained calm as his sixfoes rushed at him simultaneously, trying to bring down their prey before the advent of the guard. The old man pivoted smoothly to his left, leaving empty air for the most impetuous of his attackers. His blade then shimmered in the air, a solid arc of metal, as it cut through the arm of the bravo holding a spiked club who had moved to attack from the side. The two thugs armed with swords found themselves holding their stomachs as the old man ducked low under the hissing attack of the chain-wielding man and spun low under their guard, bringing his blade around in a deadly arc.</p>
<p>Momentary silence was broken by the sound of weapons dropping to the ground andfeet racing down the cobblestone street. The old man raised himselffrom his crouching position and calmly cleaned his weapon as he watched the bandits attempt to flee from the newly arrived city guard.

<h2><a name="MAC_8.1">8.1</a> OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>The Weapon Style skills are a new concept presented in this companion. Each Weapon Style skill offers a set of Unique capabilities and benefits to the practitioner in cornbat. The additional training required by the weapon style allows its user to become more efficient and economical in the use of his weapon.</p>
<p>The weapon stylist's advanced training in the use of his weapon allows him to exceed certain limitations that restrict the common practitioner of his specific weapon. For example, a weapon stylist can have a reduced fumble range or bonus to melee initiative as a benefit of his training.</p>
<p>The mechanics of using weapon styles are the same as any other <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Combat_Maneuver">Combat Maneuver</a> skill. When in combat, the weapon stylist will always use the lesser of his Weapon Style skill OB or his Weapon skill OB. As long as the weapon stylist is using his Weapon Style skill, he can receive the special benefits conferred by this skill.</p>
<p>Any modifiers that directly affect a character's OB will also affect his Weapon Style skill OB (except professional category bonuses that only affect Weapon skills). Allowable OB modifiers to weapon styles include spells, item bonuses (assuming it is the primary weapon of the style), and some skill bonuses (e.g., a +10 OB bonus due to a successful <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Strength">Adrenal Strength</a> maneuver).</p>
<p>Any bonuses that a weapon style confers upon a character are only applicable while the character is actively using that Style (i.e., the character is attacking using the weapon Style). If a player decides to not use his Weapon Style skill to attack, none of the benefits of that weapon style will be available even if the player chooses to use the weapon associated with that particular weapon style. See <a href="#MAC_14.2.1">Section 14.2.1</a> for further discussion.</p>

<h2><a name="MAC_8.2">8.2</a> CREATING A WEAPON STYLE</h2>
<p>Gamemasters are encouraged to create their own weapon styles for use in their games. The rules and guidelines detailed here will help to make the process easier and provide game balance. Weapon styles are created using a point-based system. These points are referred to as "style points" and they are only used during the creation of the weapon style skill. After a weapon style is created it will either be classified as a Basic or Advanced Weapon Style skill (based on its total style point cost). <a href="MAC_8.3">Section 8.3</a> presents some examples of created weapon styles.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Basic Weapon Styles can range from 0 to 30 style points.</p></li>
<li><p>Advanced Weapon Styles range can from over 31 to up to 60 style points. It is not advised to create a weapon style that uses more than 60 style points.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5><a name="MAC_8.2.0.0.1">8.2.0.0.1</a> Steps of Creation</h5>
<p>The first step in creating a new weapon style is choosing the general focus of the weapon style. The style can be based on can be an individual weapon, a group of related weapons, or a weapon category. The broader the range of weapons the style includes, the more expensive the weapon style will be to learn. In addition, the type of weapon chosen will dictate some of the options available for the weapon style. If the weapon style is based upon a two-handed weapon, any options that require the practitioner to have a hand free will not be available within this specific weapon style. Choose one of the following weapon categories as the primary focus of the new weapon style.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One-handed Edged or One-handed Concussion Weapon Categories &mdash; Allowed choices for the weapon style: Standard options; Melee weapon options; One hand free options</p></li>
<li><p>Two-handed or Pole Arm Weapon Categories &mdash; Allowed choices for the weapon style: Standard options; Melee weapon options</p></li>
<li><p>Missile Weapon Category &mdash; Allowed choices for the weapon style: Standard options; Missile weapon options</p></li>
<li><p>Thrown Weapon Category &mdash; Allowed choices for the weapon style: Standard options; Thrown weapon options; One hand free options</p></li>
<li><p>Artillery Weapon Category &mdash; It is not possible to create a weapon style with the Artillery Weapon category.</p></li>

<p><strong>All-Around Attack</strong>&mdash;The character can make attacks against foes who have a positional modifier (such as flank or rear) against him without changing his facing or position. The OB is penalized by double the positional bonus of the opponent (i.e., attacking a foe to the rear results in a -50 OB modifier). <tt>[15 points]</tt></p>
<p><strong>All-Around Defense</strong>&mdash;The character can choose to negate one positional bonus that a foe has against him during a combat round by taking a 10% action. <tt>[15 points]</tt></p>
<p><strong>Weapon-Breaker</strong>&mdash;The character has learned to incorporate special maneuvers into his attacks that are designed to cause his opponents' weapons to break. Any foe fighting the character has his breakage numbers increased by one for the duration of the combat (e.g., if the weapon's breakage numbers are normally 1 through 5 they will be 1 through 6 while the foe is fighting this character). In addition, the foe must modify the weapon strength rolls by -10. <tt>[10 points]</tt></p>

<p><strong>Additional Melee Weapon Attack</strong>&mdash;This weapon style allows two distinct weapon strikes per attack action. Through extensive training the character can use a one-handed weapon in your off-hand along whenever the character uses his weapon style. The cost for this option is triple the base weapon style cost for the secondary weapon type (see <a href="#MAC_8.2.1">Section 8.2.1</a>). Skill with this weapon must be developed separately as a normal weapon skill. When a character takes an attack action, he makes an attack roll for each weapon with the restrictions shown below. <tt>[varies]</tt>
<ol>
<li><p>The OB for each weapon attack is the lesser of the Weapon Style skill bonus or the skill bonus for the weapon.</p></li>
<li><p>Any penalty for parrying or special attacks must modify both weapon OBs equally. If the character is attacking two separate foes, the amount of OB dedicated for the parry or special attack may be split between them,</p></li>
<li><p>The character can strike one opponent with both attacks at no extra penalty.</p></li>
<li><p>The character can attack two separate opponents as long as neither of the opponents is receiving a positional bonus against the character. The character must take a -20 modifier to both weapon OBs (this is applied after restriction #1).</p></li>
</ol><blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> If a weapon style includes additional attacks with a mace held in the off-hand, the cost for this option would be 15 style points (5 x 3). The character could choose to attack with each weapon against the same opponent or to attack two separate opponents with a special -20 modifier.</blockquote></p>
<p><strong>Paired Weapon Attack</strong>&mdash;This weapon style allows enhanced combat strikes by using two weapons. Unlike the additional melee attack option, the paired weapon attack does not allow an extra strike but makes each strike more deadly. For purposes of determining the melee OB for the single attack, the lesser of the Weapon Style skill bonus and the primary weapon OB is used.</p>
<p>Any attack that delivers a critical will do an additional critical of two levels less severity (using the same dice roll). If the normal critical result is an 'A' critical, the secondary critical is treated as an 'A' critical modified by -40 (modified rolls less than zero result in no effect). If the normal critical result is a 'B' critical, the secondary critical is resolved as an 'A' critical modified by -20 (modified rolls less than zero result in no effect). The type of additional critical delivered should be determined by the GM (but is normally the most common type for the paired weapons). When fighting creatures that take Large or Super Large criticals, no additional critical is delivered. The cost for this option is double the base weapon cost of the secondary weapon. <tt>[varies]</tt></p>
<p><strong>Additional Unarmed Attack</strong>&mdash;This weapon style specializes in using strikes, kicks, and other unarmed fighting techniques while in melee combat. The unarmed attack skill must be developed separately. The cost for this additional attack is 10 points for a Degree 1 damage threshold and 15 points for a Degree 2 damage threshold (damage thresholds cannot be taken higher than Degree 2). When this style is created, the type of unarmed attack (either Striking or Sweeping) must be chosen. When a character, takes an attack action, the restrictions shown below must also be observed. <tt>[10 or 15 points]</tt>
<ol>
<li><p>The OB for the unarmed attack is the lesser of the Weapon Style skill bonus or the skill bonus for the unarmed attacking skill.</p></li>
<li><p>Any OB penalty for parrying or special attacks must modify both attacks equally. If the character is attacking two separate foes, the amount of OB dedicated the parry or special attack may be split between them.</p></li>
<li><p>The character can strike one opponent with both attacks at no penalty.</p></li>
<li><p>The character can attack two separate opponents as long as neither opponent has a positional bonus against him. In addition, he must take a -20 modifier to both his weapon OB and unarmed attack OB.</p></li>
</ol></p>
<p><strong>Additional Thrown Weapon Attack</strong>&mdash;This weapon style specializes in thrown weapons in melee combat. The thrown weapon skill must be developed separately. The cost for this additional attack is triple the base cost of the thrown weapon attack. When a character takes an attack option, the restrictions shown below must also be met. <tt>[varies]</tt>
<ol>
<li><p>The OB for the thrown weapon is the lesser of the weapon style bonus or the skill bonus for the thrown weapon.</p></li>
<li><p>Any penalty for parrying or special attacks must modify both weapon OBs equally. If the character is attacking two separate foes, the amount of OB dedicated to the parry or special attack may be split between them.</p></li>
<li><p>The character can strike one opponent with both attacks at no penalty.</p></li>
<li><p>The character can attack two separate opponents as long as neither of the opponents has a positional bonus against him. In addition, he must take a -20 modifier to both weapon OBs.</p></li>
</ol><blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> If the weapon style includes an additional thrown weapon attack that includes all short knives, the cost for this option would be 30(10 x 3).</blockquote></p>
<p><strong>Defensive Ward</strong>&mdash;This style specializes in using a particular weapon or object to parry incoming attacks. The character may not attack with his secondary weapon or object, while using those benefits to his defense. Each round, the character can choose one of the following options. <tt>[10 points]</tt>
<ol>
<li><p>Increase the normal DB from his secondary weapon by 10 against one opponent (e.g., a normal shield would give +30 DB instead of +20).</p></li>
<li><p>Affect an additional opponent with his DB due to his parrying item. The additional opponent cannot have a positional bonus on the character.</p></li>
</ol><blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> A weapon style that incorporates a main-gauche as a defensive weapon coutd use the passive DB of the main gauche against two opponents or he could use it with an additional +10 DB against one opponent.</blockquote></p>
<p><strong>Shield Training</strong>&mdash;This style specializes in using a shield to its maximum potential during combat. One type of shield must be picked when this option is chosen. Available shield types are target (this includes all "buckler"-sized shields), normal, full, and wall shields. Each round, the character can choose one of the following options. <tt>[20 points]</tt>
<ol>
<li><p>He can increase his shield DB against one opponent by 15.</p></li>
<li><p>He can affect an additional opponent with his shield DB. The additional opponent cannot have a positional bonus on the character. This option cannot be chosen with a style that uses wall shields.<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> A weapon style that incorporates the use of a full shield could increase its DB by 15 against one opponent, or use his normal shield bonus against two opponents.</blockquote></p></li>
<li><p>He can make a <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Shield_Bash">Shield Bash</a> attack on the Ram/Butt Attack Table. The maximum result is limited by the Small damage threshold (target shields also suffer an OB penalty of -20 to reflect their small size and weight).

<h3><a name="MAC_8.3.1">8.3.1</a> JAPANESE WEAPON STYLES</h3>
<p>Japanese weapon fighting systems were highly developed throughout the history of this small island nation. As a result, the style points ranges for Japanese weapon styles may be changed from the original ranges given for the skills in <a href="#MAC_8.1">Section 8.1</a>.</p>
<blockquote id="option"><strong>Optional Rule [Core]:</strong> When designing Japanese weapon styles, Basic Weapon Styles range from 0 to 35 style points and Advanced Weapon Styles range from 36 to 45 style points.</blockquote>
<h5><a name="MAC_8.3.1.0.1">8.3.1.0.1</a> Bo-Jutsu (Quarterstaff)</h5>
<p><strong>Basic Weapon Style</strong> <tt>[30 style points]</tt></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>&mdash;This weapon style specializes in the use of the staff as a weapon. The wooden staff, while inelegant compared to the sword, was nevertheless an effective weapon in combat and could not be neglected by the bushi (warrior class) in feudal Japan. The standard length of staff for training was the six foot staff that was also known as the rokushaku-bo.</p>
<p>While the art of bo-jutsu focuses on tactics that can be used to subdue an aggressive swordsman, it is also useful against other types of weapons. The training concentrates on methods of blocking, parrying, and thrusting against an opponent. The wielder is also taught to use the longer range of his weapon to keep foes at bay and to prevent foes from closing the range to a point where the staff becomes ineffective.</p>
<p>Formal training in the use of the staff as a weapon was taught in over threehundred different traditions in feudal Japan. For more information on the historical development of the Japanese martial arts, see <a href="#MAC_2.4">Section 2.4</a></p>
<p><strong>Recommended Skills</strong>&mdash;Bo (Quarterstaff) weapon skill</p>
<p><strong>Weapon Style Abilities [Core]</strong>&mdash;Bo (Quarterstaff) melee attack <tt>[5 points]</tt>; +2 bonus to initiative <tt>[10 points]</tt>; All-around defense <tt>[15 points]</tt></p>
<h5><a name="MAC_8.3.1.0.2">8.3.1.0.2</a> Iai-Jutsu (Sword)</h5>
<p><strong>Advanced Weapon Style</strong> <tt>[55 style points]</tt></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>&mdash;Iai-jutsu is the Japanese art of sword fighting that seeks to perfect the single deadly stroke of a sword. The essence of this system is the focus on lightning speed and unwavering accuracy with the goal of cutting down an enemy with one stroke. Much of the training involves defensive maneuvers to protect the adept from unexpected attack. Unlike many other Japanese martial arts, much of the training for this style is done as a solo exercise. Because this style seeks to prepare the wielder to react to unexpected attacks, much of the training begins from a low crouching position to simulate combat that starts from a sitting position.</p>
<p>There are four distinct areas of emphasis in the art of iai-jutsu. The first is the nukitsuke, or draw; the second is the kiritsuke, or cutting action; the third is the chiburi, or removal of blood from the blade; and the fourth is the noto, or return of the blade to the scabbard.</p>
<p>This discipline teaches the swordsman to evade multiple attacks from the front, side, and rear. The adept of this weapon style spends several hours each day practicing his draws and attacks with his blade. A central goal of this style is to reach a state of meditative awareness in which the adept can react instantly to any attack. Over four hundred formal traditions taught the art of iai-jutsu in feudal Japan. See <a href="#MAC_2.4">Section 2.4</a> for more information on the historical development of Japanese martial arts.</p>

<h5><a name="MAC_8.3.1.0.3">8.3.1.0.3</a> Ken-Jutsu (Sword)</h5>
<p><strong>Advanced Weapon Style</strong> <tt>[60 style points]</tt></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>&mdash;Ken-jutsu is the Japanese art of offensive sword fighting. In feudal Japan, the slightest error in combat with a skilled opponent meant death. To survive in a sword fight to the death, the Japanese warrior codified and practiced many strikes and counters that he might encounter in a duel. After time, these techniques were standardized and incorporated into a growing canon of swordmanship. Most individual schools of ken-jutsu practiced a policy of secrecy regarding their attacking techniques to preserve an advantage over their competitors. The result of this practice was that individual swordsmen seeking to improve their skills would travel from school to school in feudal Japan, fighting with other students and learning what new techniques they could in the case of a defeat.</p>
<p>Ken-jutsu is an extremely deadly and focused fighting style. Techniques in ken-jutsu involve cutting (kiri) and thrusting (tsuri). Like most Japanese martial arts, training was always done in natural terrain against opponents to mimic combat conditions.</p>
<p>Some ken-jutsu styles taught two-sword combat. At the height of the waning states period in Japan, there were over seventeen hundred distinct styles of ken-jutsu. See <a href="#MAC_2.4">Section 2.4</a> for more information on the development of Japanese martial arts.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Skills</strong>&mdash;Katana weapon skill, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Meditation">Meditation</a></p>

<h5><a name="MAC_8.3.1.0.4">8.3.1.0.4</a> Kusarigama-Jutsu (Sickle and Chain)</h5>
<p><strong>Advanced Weapon Style</strong> <tt>[35 style points]</tt></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>&mdash;The kusarigama is several weapons in one. It is at once a bladed weapon, a stick weapon, and a flail. The user of a kusari-gama can slash or cut the enemy with his blade, entangle him with his chain, club him with his hardwood handle, and strike him with the iron weight at the end of the chain. The use of this weapon required expert skill and patience to overcome better-armed opponents. The most important skill taught is the ensnaring or maki technique. The wielder was taught to entangle his opponent at the moment of his attack. The versatility of this dangerous weapon required extensive training and practice to learn properly. See <a href="#MAC_2.4">Section 2.4</a> for more information on the development of Japanese martial arts.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Skills</strong>&mdash;Kursarigama weapon skill, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Disarm_Foe_(Armed)">Disarm Foe</a></p>
<p><strong>Weapon Style Abilities [Core]</strong>&mdash;Kusari-gama melee attack <tt>[5 points]</tt>; +15 bonus to <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Disarming_Foe_(Armed)">Disarm Foe (1H-edged)</a> attempts <tt>[10 points]</tt>; Reduce kusari-gama fumble range by 3 (to minimum fumble range of 01 -02) <tt>[10 points]</tt>; +2 bonus to initiative <tt>[10 points]</tt></p><h5><a name="MAC_8.3.1.0.5">8.3.1.0.5</a> Kyu-Jutsu (Long Bow)</h5>
<p><strong>Advanced Weapon Style</strong> <tt>[35 style points]</tt></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>&mdash;Kyu-jutsu is the Japanese art of bowmanship. The longbow has long had an important place in Japanese history. At the end of the tenth century, Masaisugo Zensho formalized techniques for the bow and arrow. The dai-kyu or traditional bow used by Japanese archers possessed an asymmetrical shape; up to two-thirds of the bow's length was above the archer's left hand. The bow itself was made of a combination of wood and bamboo toughened by fire treatment. The bow's great length required several men to string it successfully. Three- and four-men bows were the most common type of bows used by archers. The arrows used by Japanese archers while of a uniform three feet in length, possessed several different types of heads depending on their use. Some arrows made noise as they flew and were used to either terrorize the enemy or as signals. Other arrows were specifically designed to penetrate armor or to cut through cords.</p>
<p>The yugamae, or correct posture, was of the utmost importance in the battlefield effectiveness of the Japanese bowman. The bowman was trained to unify with his target and his bow to release his arrows with the maximum accuracy. The mechanical movements of reloading the bow and drawing the bow were formalized and practiced often so that they became unconscious actions of the bowman. In addition, the archer was trained in sustained long distance shooting to pin enemy forces down.</p>
<p>See <a href="#MAC_2.4">Section 2.4</a> for more information on the development of the Japanese martial arts,</p>

<h5><a name="MAC_8.3.1.0.6">8.3.1.0.6</a> Naginata-Jutsu (Halberd)</h5>
<p><strong>Basic Weapon Style</strong> <tt>[20 style points]</tt></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>&mdash;In Japan, the naginata (similar to a halberd) became an effective weapon against mounted or unmounted foes in the hands of an expert. In open terrain, the naginaia was an excellent weapon because its reach allowed the warrior to keep his foe at bay while at the same time launching attacks against him. In combat, the wielder of the naginata used short slashes and circular movements to harry and attack his foe. As with most Japanese weapon systems, training with the naginata was on open terrain to simulate battlefield conditions. However in wooded or close terrain, the naginata became much less useful. See <a href="#MAC_2.4">Section 2.4</a> for more information on the development of Japanese martial arts.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Skills</strong>&mdash;Naginaia weapon skill</p>
<p><strong>Weapon Style Abilities [Core]</strong>&mdash;Naginata melee attack <tt>[5 points]</tt>; +4 bonus to initiative <tt>[15 points]</tt></p>
<h5><a name="MAC_8.3.1.0.7">8.3.1.0.7</a> Shuriken-Jutsu</h5>
<p><strong>Basic Weapon Style</strong> <tt>[25 style points]</tt></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>&mdash;This weapon style specializes in learning how to throw shuriken (Japanese throwing weapons) accurately and quickly at a target. This weapon style incorporates special throwing techniques to ensure more accurate results. Shuriken range in appearance from iron bolts that can be thrown for greater range and penetration to the familiar bladed star that can be thrown for a greater chance to hit the target.</p>
<p>This weapon style also covers the techniques for readying ashuriken secretly for a quick attack against an unsuspecting opponent. The wielder uses his own body to shield the preparation of the weapon, until his foe is within range and then he unleashes with a deadly attack. The master of shuriken-jutsu is taught to throw quickly and accurately at the vulnerable parts of the body rarely covered by armor: the face and neck.</p>
<p>Typically this weapon style is taught as part of training in the art of the ninja (the ninja were spies and assassins in feudal Japan), For more information on the historical development of the Japanese martial arts, refer to <a href="#MAC_2.4">Section 2.4</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Skills</strong>&mdash;Thrown Shuriken weapon skill, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Missile_Deflecting">Missile Deflecting</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Quickdraw">Quickdraw</a></p>

<h5><a name="MAC_8.3.1.0.8">8.3.1.0.8</a> So-Jutsu (Spear)</h5>
<p><strong>Basic Weapon Style</strong> <tt>[30 style points]</tt></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>&mdash;The yari or spear is one of the oldest weapons used in Japan and figures prominently in the religious and cultural traditions of Japan. The spear did not initially come into wide favor with the bushi, or professional warrior since they associated the sword and ken-jutsu with their rank and station in life. However, the warrior-priests of Japan known as so-hei embraced the weapon and developed sophisticated techniques using the spear.</p>
<p>The warrior using the yari, or spear, trained to become skilled with his thrusts (tsuki) and in maintaining the correct combat distance for the effective use of the spear. The spear was used from the ground or horseback in most cases. A benefit of the training in the use of the spear was that the warrior became very skilled in anticipating tactics of his foes and in closing the engagement distance so that he could use his primary weapon (usually a sword).</p>
<p>Only after the Muromachi period in feudal Japan was the spear welcomed by the bushi class and taught formally in schools.

<p><strong>Basic Weapon Style</strong> <tt>[30 style points]</tt></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>&mdash;The tetsubo was a solid iron bar used in much the same manner as a staff. The tetsubo was of varying lengths and shapes. It often had a circular or hexagonal cross-section. The bar would taper from one end to the narrower handle. This weapon required immense physical strength to wield properly and could be dangerous to the wielder if not treated with respect. The art of tetsubo-jutsu concentrated on using (and maintaining) the tremendous force generated by swinging the staff while attacking.</p>
<p>The drawback to this weapon was that its immense weight could be a liability to the wielder if faced with a quicker opponent. The wielder had to swing his weapon very rapidly to prevent quicker opponents from taking advantage of openings in his defense. See <a href="#MAC_16.3">Section 16.3</a> for more information on the development of Japanese martial arts.</p>

<h5><a name="MAC_8.3.1.0.10">8.3.1.0.10</a> Tessen-Jutsu (Iron Fan)</h5>
<p><strong>Basic Weapon Style</strong> <tt>[20 style points]</tt></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>&mdash;This weapon style specialized in the use of the fan as a weapon. In feudal Japanese society, the fan was considered part of the dress and equipment of the professional warrior. In some social situations, a warrior might be required to leave his swords with his host, but with a fan (tessen) carried in his sash he was never totally unarmed. If need required it, the warrior could defend himself with his tessen from attackers. In actuality, the fan referred to by this weapon style only appeared to be the classical fragile fan; in fact, the actual fan used by practitioners of this weapon style was different. The tessen came in two types. The first type only appeared to be a fan, as it could not be opened. The second type could be opened. In both cases, iron was used to construct the tessen to give it the strength and durability it needed to survive combat. The solid (or unopenable) tessen was the more popular type to use since it had greater strength.</p>
<p>In combat the tessen was used in much the same manner as a short stick. It was used to block incoming attacks and retaliate with poking attacks against vital points. The wielder of this style carefully selected sashikata (or the proper way of wearing the tessen) to have it instantly available if need arose. Training with the tessen involved learning how to block attacks (uke) parry incoming attacks (nagashi), striking (uchi), and thrusting (tsuki). However, the tessen was primarily viewed as a defensive weapon, for use only when the warrior's true weapons were not available.</p>
<p>Almost one hundred different traditions formalized the use of the tessen in combat in feudal Japan. For more information on the historical development of the Japanese martial arts, see <a href="#MAC_2.4">Section 2.4</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="MAC_8.3.2">8.3.2</a> EUROPEAN WEAPON STYLES</h3>
<p>European cultures did not develop fighting systems to a high a degree as Asian cultures. As a result, the style point ranges for European weapon styles may be reduced from the original ranges given for the skills in <a href="#MAC_8.1">Section 8.1</a>. Though European weapon styles are more highly devel oped than their European martial arts styles, they still far below the average level of sophistication of Eastern weapon fighting systems.</p>

<p><strong>Advanced Weapon Style</strong> <tt>[35 style points]</tt></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>&mdash;Many fencing schools arose in Italy, France, and Spain to teach the effective use of the blade. While different fencing styles did exist during the golden age of fencing, they also shared many traits. The common stance for single rapier fencing is to present only the weapon arm and side of your body to your opponent to limit his targets for attack. The use of the point, rather than the edge is also emphasized. Fencing emphasizes straight-line attacks with the target being the face or stomach of the opponent. The later fencing techniques introduced the lunge, a quick strike made by extending the arm as the lead foot extends out and bends to attack your opponent from a greater range. Unlike Olympic fencing, combat fencing is a much more cautious affair. The true winner is he who strikes without being hit in return, not just he who strikes first without regard for personal safety. See <a href="#MAC_2.7">Section 2.7</a> for more on the development of European martial arts.</p>

<h5><a name="MAC_8.3.2.0.2">8.3.2.0.2</a> Italian Fencing (with Dagger or Cloak)</h5>
<p><strong>Basic Weapon Style</strong> <tt>[20 style points]</tt></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>&mdash;Many fencing schools arose in Europe to teach the effective use of the blade. Some of the first fencing schools were opened in Italy. Common with Italian fencing masters was the teaching of techniques for using a secondary object in the off-hand to parry attacks. When fencing with a dagger in the off-hand, the dagger was used as a defensive weapon to parry the thrusting attacks of the opponent rather than an additional offensive attack as might be first thought. In fact, the object carried in the off-hand was not always a dagger, in some cases a cloak or buckler was used instead. The reasoning behind this teaching was direct and simple. The blade had the longest reach and as such should be used for attacking the opponent. It was considered unwise to maneuver close enough to your opponent to thrust a dagger into his ribs when you could do the same from a much greater range with the blade. The use of these items in combat was to parry incoming attacks so that the blade would be free to attack in turn. Fighting cloaks were made out of stiff material and were smaller than normal cloaks of the period. The cape was be sturdy enough to withstand the abuse of being cut or thrust with a rapier. Typically the cape was held either by the collar or at one edge close to the hem. The cloak could be used offensively to entangle a blade or twirled or flicked at your opponent to confuse them. The bucklers were likewise very small shields that were primarily used defensively though a wielder could punch a foe with a buckler.

<h1><a name="MAC_9.0">9.0</a> MARTIAL ARTS STYLES</h1>
<blockquote><p>The slow rhythmic beating of the drum began as the two masters bowed to each otherfrom opposite sides of the rough dirt ring. Arrayed in a semi-circle behind their masters, their students held banners and signs proclaiming the strength and power of their schools. One master was a slender young man in a white robe embroidered with wading and flying cranes, I later learned his name was Chu Ho and that he was the youngest man to be awarded the rank of master ofthe Imperial Tiger style in overforty years and as such he was known as the Young Master to hisfriends. Hisface appeared impassive as he stared at his adversary across the ring. The other master, an older man in an ornate but threadbare robe stood motionless on the other side of the ring. 1 later learned his name was Hsieh Fu and that he was known as the Iron Palm in the martial arts world.</p>
<p>Their students yelled and clamored behind their masters, urging each to victory. I narrowly avoided being caught in a fight between some of the more impetuous students from each side. Luckily another bystander intervened and calmed the students down. When I looked back at the ring, the masters were circling slowly around each other as the pace of the drumbeats began to increase,</p>
<p>Suddenly Chu Ho moved closer to Hsieh Fu and launched a lightning-like volley of hand strikes aimed at his head and throat that I recognized from the teachings of my master as the feared Seven Claws of the Tiger attack. Hsieh Fu ducked back and raised his arms to deflect most of the blows, but one slipped through and hit him on the side of the head. Momentarily dazed by the blow Hsieh Fu let his attention waver for an instant and the younger Chu Ho sensed his advantage. Chu Ho crouched low and unleashed a viscous spinning kick against the older master's legs. Hsieh Fu was knocked down on his side, but he used his motion to tumble awayfrom Chu Ho. Chu Ho followed the path of the older master's retreat, stamping and striking at the rolling form that was barely out of his reach.</p>
<p>Somehow the Young Master made a mistake; perhaps he wasfollowing too closely or became overeager sensing his foe's imminent defeat. In any case, he launched his trademark Seven Claws of the Tiger attack once more against Hsieh Fu. At the same instant, Hsieh Fu reversed his roll and tumbled inside the Young Master's defenses. Hsieh Fu then unleashed a twisting and spinning kickfrom the ground that simultaneously knocked the Young Master back a few steps and put Hsieh Fu back on his feet. Before Chu Ho could guard himself, Hsieh Fu closed with him again and launched one blow into the center of the Young Master's chest. Chu Ho flew fifteen feet back from the center of the ring into the suddenly quiet group of his students. I now recalled why Hsieh Fu was called the Iron Palm in the world ofmartial arts.</p>
<p>Hsieh Fu bowed again to the judges and the unconscious Chu Fu before striding out of the ring. Half the crowd followed him and his students back to his small school at the outskirts ofthe city. I think that this week, Hsieh's school of martial arts will be getting a record number of new students.</p>

<h2><a name="MAC_9.1">9.1</a> OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>The Martial Arts Style skills are a new concept presented in this companion. Each Martial Arts Style skill represents a set of unique capabilities and benefits to the user in combat. Training in a martial arts style allows its user to become more efficient and economical with his unarmed attacks.</p>
<p>The martial artist's advanced training in unarmed combat allows him to exceed certain limitations to which the common unarmed combatant is bound. For example, a martial artist could have improved attack skills or a bonus to initiative as a benefit of his training.</p>
<p>The mechanics of using martial arts styles are the same as any other <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Martial_Arts_Combat_Maneuver">Martial Arts Combat Maneuvers</a> skill. When in combat, the martial artist will always use the lesser of his Martial Arts Style skill OB or the appropriate unarmed martial arts attack OB. As long as the martial artist uses his Martial Arts Style skill, he can receive the special benefits conferred by this skill.</p>
<p>Any modifiers that directly affect a character's unarmed combat OB will also effect his Martial Arts Style skill OB. Allowable OB modifiers to martial arts styles include spells and skill bonuses that affect OB (e.g., a +10 OB bonus from a successful <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Strength">Adrenal Strength</a> maneuver).</p>
<p>Any bonuses that a martial arts style confers upon a character are only applicable while the character is actively using that style (i.e., the character is attacking using the martial arts style). If a player decides to not use his Martial Arts Style skill to attack, none of the benefits of the martial arts style can be used. See <a href="#MAC_14.2.1">Section 14.2.1</a> for further discussion.</p>

<h2><a name="MAC_9.2">9.2</a> CREATING A MARTIAL ARTS STYLE</h2>
<p>Gamemasters are encouraged to create their own martial arts styles for use in their games. The rules and guidelines detailed here will help to make the process easier and more game-balanced. Martial arts styles are created using a point-based system. These points are referred to as style points and they are only used during the creation of the Martial Arts Style skill. After a martial arts style is created, it will either be classified as a Basic or Advanced Martial Arts Style skill (based on its total style point cost).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Basic Martial Arts Style skills range from 0 to 30 style points.</p></li>
<li><p>Advanced Martial Arts Style skills range from 31 to up to 60 style points. It is not advised to create a martial arts style that uses more than 60 style points.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5><a name="MAC_9.2.0.0.1">9.2.0.0.1</a> Steps of Creation</h5>
<p>The first step in creating a martial arts style is deciding what types of martial arts attacks will be available in the style. The martial arts style can be based on several different degrees of martial arts attacking techniques. The more techniques that a martial arts style encompasses, the more expensive the martial arts style will be to learn. <a href="#MAC_9.3">Section 9.3</a> provides some examples of created martial arts styles.</p>

The damage threshold for Nerve Strikes must be less than or equal to the damage threshold for Martial Arts Striking and the damage thresholds for Locking Holds must also be less than or equal to the damage thresholds for Martial Arts Sweeping.

<p><strong>Additional Strike</strong>&mdash;The martial artist can make an additional martial arts strike during his attack action. The cost for this option varies according to the highest damage threshold in the martial arts style. A Degree 1 attack costs 5 style points, a Degree 2 attack costs 10 style points, a Degree 3 attack costs 15 style points, and a Degree 4 attack costs 20 style points. Each of the restrictions listed below must be followed to use this ability. <tt>[5, 10, 15, or 20 points]</tt>

<li><p>The OB for both strikes is the lesser of the Martial Arts Style skill OB or the martial arts attack skill OB used in either strike.</p></li>
<li><p>If the martial artist attacks one opponent with both attacks,</p></li>
<li><p>If the martial artist attempts to attack two separate opponents, each attack suffers a -20 to the attack roll.

<li><p>If the martial artist decides to parry or attempt a special attack, he must reduce that OB for each attack by the amount ofOB dedicated to his parry or special attack. Against one opponent, a parry simply increases his DB, against two opponents he may split his parry as he sees fit.</p></li>
</ol></p>
<p><strong>All-Around Attack</strong>&mdash;The martial artist can make attacks against foes who have a positional modifier (such as flank or rear) against him without changing his facing or position. The OB is penalized by double the positional bonus of the opponent (i.e., attacking a foe to the rear you results in a -50 OB modifier). <tt>[10 points]</tt></p>
<p><strong>All-Around Defense</strong>&mdash;The weapon stylist can choose to negate one positional bonus that a foe has against him during a combat round by taking a 10% action. <tt>[10 points]</tt></p>
<p><strong>Weapon Kata</strong>&mdash;The martial artist can use a weapon with his martial arts style. A weapon kata represents a weapon attack that is taught as part of the martial arts style attack. The martial artist uses cither his Martial Arts Style skill OB or his martial arts attack skill OB, whichever is the lesser of the two, with an additional -20 modifier as his total OB using the weapon. The martial arts style must include at least a Degree 2 martial arts attack skill to include this option (Degree 3 if the weapon requires two hands to wield or if the kata uses two-weapons kata or paired weapon kata). The martial artist uses the normal fumble range for his weapon while he is using the weapon kata (unless modified by the martial arts style). The weapon's normal attack table is used to determine the result of the strike (instead of the martial arts attack tables). Any criticals delivered are the determined normally for the weapon.

<h5><a name="MAC_9.2.4.0.1">9.2.4.0.1</a> Special Weapon Kata Options</h5>
<p><strong>Two-weapon Kata</strong>&mdash;The martial artist has learned how to fight with paired weapons while using his weapon katas. Both weapons must be included as weapon katas for the martial arts style being used. In addition, the martial artist must abide by all restrictions for two-weapon combat. <tt>[15 points]</tt>
<ol>
<li><p>The OB for each weapon kata attack is the lesser of the Martial Arts Style skill OB or the martial arts attacking skill OB. The -20 modifier to OB due to weapon katas still applies,</p></li>
<li><p>There is no modification for attempting two attacks against the same opponent.</p></li>
<li><p>If the martial artist attempts to attack two separate opponents there is an additional -20 modifier to both attack rolls. The martial artist may attack two separate opponents as long as neither is receiving any positional bonus (note that the All-Around Attack ability can eliminate this requirement).</p></li>
<li><p>If the martial artist decides to parry or attempt a special attack, he must reduce the OB for each attack by the amount of OB dedicated to his parry or special attack. Against one opponent, a parry simply increases his DB, against two opponents he may split his parry as he sees fit.</p></li>
</ol></p>
<p><strong>Paired Weapon Kata</strong>&mdash;The martial artist has trained to fight with identical paired weapons using his weapon kata. Unlike the Two-Weapon Kata option, this does not allow the martial artist two separate strikes; instead, the one attack is more lethal.</p>
<p>Any attack that delivers a critical will do an additional critical of two levels less severity (using the same dice roll). If the normal critical result is an 'A' critical, the secondary critical is treated as an 'A' critical modified by -40 (modified rolls less than zero result in no effect). If the normal critical result is a 'B' critical, the critical, the secondary critical is resolved as an 'A' critical modified by -20 (modified rolls less than zero result in no effect). The type of additional critical delivered should be determined by the GM (but is normally the most common type for the paired weapons). When fighting creatures that take Large or Super Large criticals, no additional critical is delivered. <tt>[5 points]</tt></p>
<p><strong>Weapon-Breaker</strong>&mdash;The martial artist has learned to incorporate special maneuvers into his attacks that are designed to cause his opponent's weapons to break. Any foe fighting the martial artist while the martial artist is using his weapon kata has his breakage numbers increased by one for the duration of the combat (e.g., if the weapon's breakage numbers are normally 1 through 5 they will be 1 through 6 while the foe is fighting the martial artist). The foe must also modify weapon strength rolls by-10. <tt>[10 points]</tt></p>

<h3><a name="MAC_9.2.5">9.2.5</a> SPECIAL MANEUVERS</h3>
<p>Special maneuvers are a Heroic option for martial arts in his campaign. For each martial arts style, there can be a number of assorted special maneuvers reflecting special attacks, defenses, or techniques associated with the particular martial arts style. The creation of special maneuvers is left to the Gamemaster's imagination, but a few caveats should apply.</p>
<p>For Basic Martial Arts Styles, there should be at most one special maneuver available. For Advanced Martial Arts Styles, there should be no more than three special maneuvers available. Including too many special maneuvers in a martial arts style will tend to dilute the focus of the style, and impose unnecessary bookkeeping on both the Gamemaster and players. Special maneuvers should add uniqueness and flavor to a martial arts style, but not overshadow it.</p>
<p>If a special maneuver has an effect that is similar or better than an already existing skill, it should be balanced in one of two ways. Either the special maneuver should rely on the bonus of the similar skill, or it should have a more limitedapplicability,</p>

<h5><a name="MAC_9.3.1.0.1">9.3.1.0.1</a> Choy Lee Fut Style (Southern External Style)</h5>
<p><strong>Basic Martial Arts Style</strong> <tt>[25 style points]</tt></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>&mdash;The Choy Lee Fut style was developed during the nineteenth century in China. It started as primarily a Southern style and it later spread to Northern China. This style was originally taught to secret rebel societies trying to overthrow the Manchu Dynasty in the nineteenth century. Therefore this style was developed with a desire to teach the basics of martial arts to its students in the shortest possible amount of time. The Choy Lee Put style focuses on aggressive punching and kicking attacks until the opponent is conquered. This style uses long-range attacks to defeat foes quickly. It is best known for its knuckle jabs, uppercuts, and round-house swings. High and low kicks are used, as well as several types of kicks with 360 degree spins are featured as well. The Choy Lee Fut stylist tries to throw an opponent off-balance by moving directly at him all the while throwing hard strikes. Many of the moves of a fighter using this martial art look strikingly similar to techniques of Western boxing. See <a href="#MAC_2.1">Section 2.1</a> for more information on the historical development of Chinese martial arts.</p>

<h5><a name="MAC_9.3.1.0.2">9.3.1.0.2</a> Cobra Style (Southern Internal Style)</h5>
<p><strong>Basic Martial Arts Style</strong> [30 style points]</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>&mdash;The Cobra style is an ancient Chinese martial art. It is designed to be totally defensive in nature, modeled after a cobra lying in the grass. A master of the Cobra style will not execute acrobatic defensive maneuvers; rather he will expend as little energy as possible to avoid attacks. Most attacks against the stylist will be sidestepped rather than blocked directly. The attacks of the Cobra stylist are relentless and deadly when they are finally executed. These quick and deadly attacks are focused on the eyes and throat with hand strikes. It is said that Cobra stylists have developed deadly dim mak techniques that allow them to kill or maim with merely a touch.</p>
<p>The basic stance of the Cobra style is a defensive one, with the adept keeping his stance low to the ground and raising his hands and arms near his chest. This position mimics a cobra rising from the ground with an outspread hood. A variant of the Cobra style is the King Cobra style. See <a href="#MAC_2.1">Section 2.1</a> for more information on the historical development of Chinese martial arts.</p>

<blockquote>Strike of the Cobra&mdash;The Cobra style teaches the martial artist to strike without mercy when his foe is hurt.

<h5><a name="MAC_9.3.1.0.3">9.3.1.0.3</a> Cotton Fist Style (Northern Internal Style)</h5>
<p><strong>Basic Martial Arts Style</strong> <tt>[10 style points]</tt></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>&mdash;The Cotton Fist style is a northern style of Chinese kung fu. The name of this martial an conveys weakness, softness and slowness. This style is taught to its students very slowly. A saying about this style is "Cotton Fist, ten years stay at home," means that a student will need to practice for ten years to be able to defend himself. The cotton fist emphasizes soft training and perfection of movement. While this style is not perfect for the goal of self-defense, it is important in teaching the mental aspects of martial arts.</p>

<h5><a name="MAC_9.3.1.0.4">9.3.1.0.4</a> Crane Style (Southern External Style)</h5>
<p><strong>Advanced Martial Arts Style</strong> <tt>[55 style points]</tt></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>&mdash;The Crane style is an ancient Chinese martial art whose movements originally were formed to develop both muscular control and spiritual strength. The Crane style emphasizes rapid footwork and evasive techniques, coupled with relentless attacks. While the Crane style is considered to be the most beautiful of all Chinese Kung Fu martial arts styles, it is also one of the most complex with over ten thousand movements contained in ten basic form sets.</p>
<p>Folklore states that the Crane style was developed after a monk observed a fight between an ape and a white crane. Initially the monk expected the ape with its greater physical strength to easily crush the crane. But the white crane managed to avoid the powerful attacks of the ape and inflict accurate painful blows with its beak. The crane maintained its perfect composure as it used its short wings for balance and the long-range attack of its beak against the larger ape. Finally the ape retreated back to the forest after being severely hurt and the unharmed white crane resumed the protection of its eggs.</p>
<p>In combat, the Crane stylist will almost arrogantly disdain any physical contact with an opponent, instead opting for a single fierce blow, usually delivered from long range. The elusive footwork of the Crane stylist serves to help him avoid the attacks of his opponent. In most cases, a forceful opponent will be thrown off balance by such evasion as he strikes air. Once the opponent has lost his balance by missing his target, the Crane stylist will be ready to strike at the weakest point exposed by his off-balance foe. If a Crane stylist instead chose to physically block an incoming attack with strength, his foe could use the block to stabilize himself and deliver an immediate counter-attack. By concentrating on avoiding blows, the Crane stylist can rob an opponent of his trained block and counter-punch techniques.</p>
<p>The basic stance of the Crane style is the royal pecking form. The Crane stylist raises both arms up parallel to his body and forms the shape of a crane's beak with his hands. One foot of the stylist is kept raised to quickly strike or block. This stance actually mimics the warning posture of the true white crane. Should the strike of a Crane stylist miss, he will always attempt to retreat and set up another long-range strike rather than close with his opponent and grapple. Variants of the Crane style are the Black Crane and the Imperial Crane styles. The Black Crane style emphasizes footwork and the basic hand and foot strikes while the Imperial Crane style emphasizes the use of weapons within the traditional Crane style. See <a href="#MAC_2.1">Section 2.1</a> for more information on the historical development of Chinese martial arts.</p>

<p><strong>Special Abilities</strong>&mdash;This style has a special maneuver (Wading in the Reeds) and a special attack (Beak of the Crane).

<blockquote>Wading in the Reeds&mdash;The Crane stylist practices elusivefootwork to prepare attacks. When an attack completely misses a Crane stylist (i.e., no hits or criticals are delivered), the stylist gains a special +75 modification to his OB if he chooses to attack the foe that missed in the next combat round.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Beak of the Crane&mdash;The Crane stylist learns how to focus his energy to deliver punishing blows to his opponent. If the martial artist takes a 15% preparation action in a given round, he may attack during the following combat round with a special +75 modification to his OB.</blockquote>
<h5><a name="MAC_9.3.1.0.5">9.3.1.0.5</a> Dragon Style (Northern internal Style)</h5>
<p><strong>Advanced Martial Arts Style</strong> <tt>[60 style points]</tt></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>&mdash;The Dragon style is an ancient Chinese martial art originally designed to develop alertness and concentration. This martial arts style emphasizes controlled breathing with powerful attacking movements. The Dragon stylist uses flowing movements that explode into powerful strikes using entire force of his body. The Dragon style uses continuous advancing and retreating motions, like the movements of a serpent to prevent the opponent from landing a solid blow. The powerful hissing sound emitted by the stylist is a product of his concentrated breathing and focusing of energy.</p>
<p>The Dragon stylist trains his hands to have powerful grasping strength to grab or twist limbs with great force. The grip of an advanced Dragon stylist is said to be almost unbreakable. In addition, the legs are used to deliver powerful lashing kicks. The Dragon style emphasizes simultaneous attack and defense techniques during combat. While one hand is attacking, the other hand is held at guard, ready to grab or twist an attacker's incoming limb.</p>
<p>In defense, the Dragon stylist withdraws before a strike, absorbing its power and retaliating only when he believes his foe has over-extended himself. The dragon crouch is the basic blocking technique of the Dragon style. The stylist crouches low with his hands set in the dragon claw form and positioned in front of him. In all the varied forms of this style, the martial artist's eyes appear to look directly outward like the eyes of a reptile, no matter how much his head moves about. See <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#MAC_2.1">Section 2.1</a> for more information on the historical development of Chinese martial arts.</p>

<p><strong>Special Abilities</strong>&mdash;This style has two special attacks (Lash of the Dragon and Claws of the Dragon). In addition, all <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Strength">Adrenal Strength</a> maneuvers only take a 10% preparation action.

<h5><a name="MAC_9.3.1.0.6">9.3.1.0.6</a> Eight Drunken Fairies (Northern External Style)</h5>
<p><strong>Advanced Martial Arts Style</strong> <tt>[40 style points]</tt></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>&mdash;The Eight Drunken Fairies or Drunken Boxing style is a very deceptive martial arts style. While using the techniques of the Drunken Boxing style, the martial artist appears to stagger and lurch without any control over his body. In actuality, the martial artist is in complete control of himself at all times during this display. The apparently uncontrolled movements of the adept of this style serve to distract and bewilder his opponent, allowing the martial artist to strike unexpectedly.</p>
<p>The Drunken Boxing style uses equal amounts of striking and locking attacks. Many of the striking techniques involve punching, but some unique kicks are included as well. It is difficult to master without superb balance and coordination, but it is a quite effective style in combat.</p>

<p><strong>Special Abilities</strong>&mdash;This style has a special attack (the Drunken Fist) and a special defense (the Drunken Stagger). In addition, all <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Strength">Adrenal Strength</a> maneuvers only take a 10% preparation action (this does not affect the Drunken Fist attack). Finally, if the GM is allowing Chi Power skills, this style should allow access to either <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Chi_Powers:_Rise_of_the_Phoenix">Chi Powers: Rise of the Phoenix</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Chi_Powers:_Fists_of_Iron">Chi Powers: Fists of Iron</a>, or <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Chi_Powers:_Resist_Pain">Chi Powers: Resist Pain</a>.</p>
<blockquote>Drunken Fist&mdash;By focusing his internal energy and striking an opponent, a master of the Drunken Boxing style can do triple normal concussion damage to his foe. To successfully accomplish this feat, a special <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Strength">Adrenal Strength</a> maneuver must be made with a 40% preparation action. If the maneuver is successful, the next round the martial artist can attack with a +10 OB modifier and do triple concussion damage.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Drunken Stagger&mdash;By moving in unpredictable patterns, an adept of the Drunken Boxing style learns how to launch unexpected attacks against his opponent. Ifan adept takes a special -20 modifier to his OB, his attack happens in such an unexpected manner that his opponent will lose half of his DB against the attack.</blockquote>
<h5><a name="MAC_9.3.1.0.7">9.3.1.0.7</a> Hsing-I Style (Northern External Style)</h5>
<p><strong>Advanced Martial Arts Style</strong> <tt>[35 style points]</tt></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>&mdash;The Hsing-i style is an ancient Chinese martial art that has also been called Hsing-i Lu-ho Ch'uan or I Ch'uan. Most records suggest that Hsing-i was created in the mid-sixteenth century in Shanghai, China. Hsing-i is composed of five basic movements. Beyond these basic five movements, Hsing-i has an additional twelve sets of movements based on animals&mdash; Dragon, Tiger, Monkey, Horse, Water-skimmer (insect), Cock, Hawk, Snake, Eagle, Bear, Swallow, and Leopard. Hsing-i uses linear movements with strong fundamental balance. When attacking, an adept strikes like a wave crashing on the shore&mdash;rising, striking, falling, and overturning.</p>
<p>The five basic postures correspond to the five basic elements in Chinese philosophy&mdash;fire, water, metal, wood, and earth. The fire stance is an explosive posture from which attacks can be launched with either hand or foot. The metal stance is defensive and can be used easily to block an opponent's attack. The water stance is a very stable, wide stance in which the adept can attack with his fists. The wood stance is a very low stance that is flexible enough for the adept both to be protected from attack and able to attack. The earth stance is a wide stance that allows the adept to deflect attacks easily.</p>
<p>The practitioner of Hsing-i uses punches, low strikes, and stances similar to those of the Shaolin hard martial arts. Like the hard schools of martial arts, the student is also taught to advance in a straight line; however, the Hsing-i body posture is unusual, as the shoulders are kept rounded and many low stances are used. In this martial arts style, blocking is through circular motions that seek to deflect incoming attacks rather than directly opposing them. In addition, the practitioner mimics the actions of an animal much more closely than in hard schools that are based on animal attacks. The true master of Hsing-i learns how to see into the forms of the various animal styles and grasp their essences. This intuition can then be used to read the intent of the opponent. At the highest level of mastery, the Hsing-i stylist will be free of form and thought and be able to react instinctively to any threat. This state of mind is called "no form, no meaning."</p>
<p>There exist several similar branches of this style that espouse philosophic and stylistic differences. The Wang Hsiang-chai branch teaches that the postures are not as important as the focus of the will. The Sun Lu-t'ang branch simplifies and merges many of the basic movements and forms to provide a less complicated martial art. See <a href="#MAC_2.1">Section 2.1</a> for more information on the historical development of Chinese martial arts.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong>&mdash;The King Cobra style is a variant style of the Cobra style (see above). The unarmed attacks and movements of this fighting system are very similar to the Cobra style. Where the King Cobra style differs is in its heavier reliance on weapons.

<h5><a name="MAC_9.3.1.0.9">9.3.1.0.9</a> Iron Robe Style (Northern External Style)</h5>
<p><strong>Advanced Martial Arts Style</strong> <tt>[50 style points]</tt></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>&mdash;The Iron Robe martial arts style is a very disciplined and difficult style to learn. The student spends many years learning how strengthen his body against attacks from all directions and ignore pain. This style of martial arts requires the student lo subject himself to intense physical pain to learn how to control his reactions and still function in combat. Offensively this style relies on strong hand and foot attacks, and very few locking or throwing techniques are used. Adepts of this style rely upon their defensive skills and the ability to outlast their opponents to win challenges.</p>
<p>The name of this style comes from the ability of the adept to absorb blows that would seriously injure or even kill an unarmed man. An adept of the iron robe style does not fear weapons and would never resort to armor, as it would imply that he did not think his martial arts abilities were enough to protect himself from harm.</p>

<h5><a name="MAC_9.3.1.0.10">9.3.1.0.10</a> Monkey Style (Southern External Style)</h5>
<p><strong>Basic Martial Arts Style</strong> <tt>[30 style points]</tt></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>&mdash;The Monkey style is a Chinese martial art that traces its origins back to the early twentieth century in Peking, China. It is said that the Monkey style was created when Kua See, Chinese fighting expert, killed an officer when he resisted being drafted into the Manchu army. Kua See surrendered to police and was placed in jail in Peking. At that time, Chinese authorities used monkeys as "watchdogs." If a prisoner broke out, the monkeys sounded a loud chattering alarm that alerted the prison guards. Kua See began to study the movements of his simian jailers over the course of his ten years of imprisonment and ended up designing a fighting style.</p>
<p>The appearance of the Monkey style is very deceptive. It appears comical at times, but is actually an extremely effectivemartial arts style. The Monkey style specializes in attacking from the ground using techniques that are physically very demanding. A Monkey stylist learns how to handle falls and unleash powerful kicks from a prone position. Spinning and twisting movements are used to conceal the a target of an attack. Hand attacks are modeled after the clawing and scratching hand attacks of a monkey. Unlike many Chinese martial arts, the Monkey style uses very low defensive crouches to avoid attacks and aggressive leaps when attacking.</p>
<p>The Monkey style uses a basic defensive stance in which the stylist is ready to roll away from attacks against him. Several different variants of the Monkey style exist: Stone Monkey Style, Wooden Monkey style, and Drunken Monkey style. Of the three, the Drunken Monkey style is the most exotic. In the Drunken Monkey style the practitioner fakes drunken staggers and weaves, all the while ready to unleash a surprise attack. See <a href="#MAC_2.1">Section 2.1</a> for more information on the development of Chinese martial arts.</p>

<h5><a name="MAC_9.3.1.0.11">9.3.1.0.11</a> Pa Kua Chu'an Style (Southern Internal Style)</h5>
<p><strong>Advanced Martial Arts Style</strong> <tt>[50 style points]</tt></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>&mdash;The Pa Kua Chu'an style is an ancient Chinese martial arts style. The name of the style literally means the "eight trigrams." Legend holds that an emperor of China, Fu His (2,953-2,838 BC), invented the eight symbolic trigrams after pondering the scarred markings on the back of a tortoise shell. These trigrams were later incorporated into the I Ching. The eight trigrams figuratively express the evolution of nature and its cyclical changes &mdash; representing heaven, earth, metal, wood, water, fire, soil, and man. The Pa Kua stylist attains mastery of his art through the practice of the eight fundamental postures of the martial arts style. These postures are based on an ingenious inspiration of applying various animal forms to the eight trigrams. Each fundamental posture demonstrates the key actions of the dragon, snake, stork, hawk, lion, monkey, and bear.</p>
<p>Just as life's expressions are found in the eight trigrams of the I Ching, a Pa Kua adept asserts that all possible bodily movements are found within the eight fundamental postures. This is practiced by "walking the circle," the principle exercise leading to the perfection of Pa Kua Ch'uan, This martial art does not contain specific fighting techniques like most other martial arts styles. Instead, Pa Kua Ch'uan is a system of defense designed to avoid aggression though constant movement. The master may perform elusive circular gyrations that allow him to circle behind his attacker for a fraction of a second, sufficient time to fell his attacker with a single blow of the palm. The stylist's internal energy is focused into his palm strike, enough to stun even the most hardy foe.</p>
<p>The chief stance of this style involves "walking the circle." The Pa Kua stylist uses his footwork to walk and rotate his body while going through the complicated hand movements of the style. Fighting a skilled practitioner of this style can be very bewildering as your opponent will seem to spin away out of your field of vision before you can strike him. See <a href="#MAC_2.1">Section 2.1</a> for more information on the development of Chinese martial arts,</p>

<h5><a name="MAC_9.3.1.0.12">9.3.1.0.12</a> Praying Mantis Style (External Style)</h5>
<p><strong>Advanced Martial Arts Style</strong> <tt>[55 style points]</tt></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>&mdash;The Praying Mantis style is a Chinese martial arts style said to be created 350 years ago by a Chinese fighting master named Wang Lang. The story goes that Wang Lang was a skilled fighter who traveled to the Shaolin Temple to challenge its monks in combat but he suffered several humiliating defeats at the hands ofthe monks. While he was mediating upon his failures, he observed a fragile-looking praying mantis engaged in combat with a much larger cicada. Wang decided to capture the insect and use its defensive and offensive movements as the basis for a new fighting style. Wang observed that the insect could defend itself from attacks from all directions. Armed with his bewildering array of insect moves, Wang overwhelmingly defeated the senior monks of the Shaolin Temple. Wang's Praying Mantis school of martial arts became one of the most prominent schools of martial arts in China during his lifetime.</p>
<p>The Praying Mantis style is a very effective close-combat fighting style, A Praying Mantis stylist does not attempt long-range attacks against his foe, instead he remains in a defensive position until he has closed the distance to his foe. The style leaches the practitioner to launch powerful short-range blows with little preparation or room for motion. Like many Chinese martial arts, the Praying Mantis adept always keeps one hand free to defend at all times. There are few pure blocking movements in the Praying Mantis style. The stylist is taught to strike at an incoming limb while deflecting it or to rely upon elusive footwork to avoid the blow. Once the stylist has closed with his foe, he can then unleash a devastating series of short-range blows. The style primarily uses elbow and hand strikes since these types of attacks are very effective in close quarters. Some waist high kicks are also taught, but they are not primary attacks in of this style.</p>
<p>The on-guard position of the Praying Mantis style mimicsthe actual insect's fighting position, with the hands resembling the poised feelers. The original Praying Mantis style is called the Seven Stars style (so named for its footwork pattern). Variants of the original style are the Six Harmonies style that incorporates softer and more circular movements, and the Eight Steps style, which alters the footwork pattern of the original style. See <a href="#MAC_2.1">Section 2.1</a> for more information on the historical development of Chinese martial arts.</p>

<blockquote>Mantis Punch&mdash;The Praying Mantis adept learns how to focus his energy to deliver several precise strikes within one punching attack. The result of this attack is that the opponent will also take an Unbalancing critical of two levels less severity than any critical inflicted by an attack table (same roll). While using this ability, a special modifier of -20 is applied to the OB of the Mantis stylist (to represent the increased control find focus required for executing this technique successfully).</blockquote>
<blockquote>Stance of the Mantis&mdash;The Praying Mantis stylist learns how to use his martial arts expertise to maneuver and attack in very close confined spaces. The stylist suffers half the normal penalty for fighting within a cramped or enclosed space (see <a href="#MAC_14.6">Section 14.6</a>). In addition, as a result of this close inward stance, all Martial Arts Sweeping attacks against the martial artist suffer an additional -20 modifier due to the stylist's understanding ofstances.</blockquote>
<h5><a name="MAC_9.3.1.0.13">9.3.1.0.13</a> Snake Style (Southern External Style)</h5>
<p><strong>Advanced Martial Arts Style</strong> <tt>[60 style points]</tt></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>&mdash;The Snake style is an ancient Chinese martial art originally developed to help practitioners develop endurance and concentration. It is also an effective fighting art. The Snake style emphasizes controlled breathing and flowing movements that incorporate elaborate finger and hand movements. The movements or forms ofthe Snake style actually resemble the motions of a snake. In comparison to the Cobra style, the Snake style is much more expressive. The adept will coil his body and twist his arms to mimic the motions of the snake. Like the Cobra style, the main attack of the Snake style is hand attacks that strike at the weak points of an opponent, like the throat or eyes. The defensive postures also emphasize avoiding attacks rather than blocking.</p>
<p>When an attacker strikes at the Snake stylist, the Snake stylist is taught to strike the attacker's limb as it comes into range or to quickly sidestep the attack and deliver a pin-point strike of his own. A Snake stylist will almost never trade blows with an opponent. Rather he is taught to attack and retreat to avoid counterstrikes. There are several variants of the Snake style but common to all of these styles are precise strikes and twisting arm motions intended to disguise the true target of the attack.</p>
<p>Unlike flashier martial arts, there are few preparatory stances or threatening gestures in this style. Rather, the Snake stylist will avoid and sidestep attacks until an opportunity presents itself and then quickly and ferociously attack at a weak point. The lack of flamboyant or threatening moves in this martial arts style can be seen as a strength; a foe will not know what style ofmartial artist he is facing until it is most likely too late. See <a href="#MAC_2.1">Section 2.1</a> for more information on the historical development of Chinese martial arts.</p>

<blockquote>Hidden Strike&mdash;The Snake stylist has spent years learning how to disguise the true target of his attacks. If the martial artist has taken a 20% preparation action in the previous round, he may attempt to make a "Very Hard " static maneuver to mislead his opponent about the true target of his strike this round (against another Snake stylist, the difficulty of this maneuver roll is "Absurd"). If successful, he will gain +6 initiative and +15 OB against the foe.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Snake Rising From the Grass&mdash;The Snake stylist can use this maneuver to regain his feet from a prone position with only a 25% activity action. This maneuver is treated as a "Hard" Moving Maneuver. Failure means that the martial artist must expend the normal 50% activity action to regain his feet.</blockquote>

<h5><a name="MAC_9.3.1.0.16">9.3.1.0.16</a> Wing Chun (Northern External Style)</h5>
<p><strong>Basic Martial Arts Style</strong> <tt>[15 style points]</tt></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>&mdash;The Wing Chun style was first developed over two hundred years ago. The story behind the founding of this martial art is very interesting. The originator of this style is a woman named Yim Wing Chun who was the daughter of a food merchant. She was very beautiful and due to be wed to her love Leong Bok Chao. A powerful warlord heard of her beauty and demanded that she become one of his wives. Faced with the threat of death, her father agreed to the match. Wing Chun was shocked at the news but became resigned to her fate, she did not want to see her father or her true love die trying to defy the warlord. Fate intervened at this point. Wing Chun encountered Ng Mui a Shaulin nun who had been taught the fighting arts of the crane and the dragon. When Ng Mui heard the unfortunate Wing Chun's story, she decided to help the girl. The nun counseled the young girl to delay the wedding by a year and sum to undergo training in the martial arts. Due to the turmoil in the country at that time, the warlord accepted a delay of a year to break the existing betrothal to her true love, Leong Bok Chao. Wing Chun trained hard in the arts that Ng Mui taught her. For her part, Ng Mui simplified and streamlined the existing martial arts she already knew into this new system. After a year the warlord appeared to claim his bride, the father explained that Wing Chun had studied martial arts since she was young and would refuse to marry any man that could not defeat her in unarmed combat. Sure of his strength the warlord agreed to the challenge. His impulsive rush towards Wing Chun resulted in his defeat and he left in shame. Wing Chun married her true love and the martial art of Wing Chun was born.</p>
<p>There are three basic forms in this martial arts style. The first consists of simple arm blocks and strikes. The second form consists of more advanced blocking techniques that seek to deflect an opponent's attacks rather than match them strength to strength. The basic low kicks of the martial an are introduced as well. The last form teaches the use of finger strikes and other hand forms in attacks. This form also introduces more footwork includ- ing more low kicks and stances. While this martial art may seem very simple to the novice, the experienced martial artist can admire its elegant simplicity.</p>

<h3><a name="MAC_9.3.2">9.3.2</a> INDONESIAN MARTIAL ARTS</h3>
<p>Indonesia has a rich tradition of martial arts based on the system of fighting called pentjak-silat. All of pentjak-silat is evasive. Its normal responses to an attack are quick deceptive movements that seek to avoid direct contact with the opponent's strikes. Nearly all the movements taught in this style of combat may be performed unchanged, either empty-handed or armed. The krisand parang (machete) are blades often used with this fighting system. The penljak-silat stylist is alert and reactive to attacks. Alt pentjak-silat styles are practiced with rhythmic music that serves to heighten the atmosphere during training sessions. Most pentjak-silat movements are based on the movements of animals. The pentjak-silat stylist does not go through warming-up exercises, it is structured so the stylist can react without an opportunity to warm-up. To achieve this degree of readiness, the stylist practices and trains to achieve flexibility and strength. When sparring, the pentjak-silat stylist is taught to view his partner as his "enemy" it; preparation for actual combat. This martial art has more than twenty separate hand forms. Some of the more esoteric hand forms have descriptive names like the arrowhead fist, the beak hand, the tiger's claw fist, and the crane fist. Full-arm extensions during striking are rarely done. The pentjak-silat stylist is wary of locking his arm in a straight line, preferring to stop before his arm is fully extended.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong>&mdash;This style of pentjak-silat developed in the coastal area of Sumatra that has firm ground. The Baru stylist concentrates on developing and maintaining secure footholds while fighting. Often during combat, the stylist will dig his feet into the ground to offer a firm foothold. By using his strong footholds, the stylist can attack with great speed and power. This martial arts style uses a good balance of leg and arm tactics to attack opponents.

<p><strong>Description</strong>&mdash;The uneven and slippery ground found in the region of Sumatra has had a great influence on the development of this martial art. The Harimau (or tiger) fighter considers an upright posture during combat as ineffective it is easily to lose one's balance on the slippery ground. The stylist prefers to get close to the ground. In some cases the stylist hugs the ground, using his legs, arms, and his back, side, or belly for support. The fighter practices attacking from this low posture with powerful kicks and other attacks. He may also spring up quickly at his enemy, surprising him with powerful clawing attacks.

<h5><a name="MAC_9.3.2.0.3">9.3.2.0.3</a> Kumango Pentjak-Silat</h5>
<p><strong>Basic Martial Arts Style</strong> <tt>[30 style points]</tt></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>&mdash;The loose and sandy soil found in the region of Sumatra has strongly influenced the development of this martial art. This version of pentjak-silat prefers to use an upright stance. This style uses an effective balance of arm and leg attacks, but often arm strikes only serve to distract the opponent, setting him up for a powerful kick. Stylists sometimes slap a free hand against a thigh or throw sand to distract their foe. The skillful footwork found in this style sets up the powerful leg strikes found in this system.

<h3><a name="MAC_9.3.3">9.3.3</a> JAPANESE MARTIAL ARTS</h3>
<p>This is an overview of a sampling of Japanese martial arts styles.</p><h5><a name="MAC_9.3.3.0.1">9.3.3.0.1</a> Ju-Jutsu</h5>
<p><strong>Basic Martial Arts Style</strong> <tt>[15 style points]</tt></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>&mdash;Ju-jutsu is an ancient Japanese martial art that stresses unarmed techniques. Ju-jutsu includes methods of kicking, striking, throwing, and joint-locking. From within the ju-jutsu forms came the systemized development of striking vital points called atemi. This Japanese system of classifying vital points remained less developed than the Chinese methods due to the restriction of these techniques to the warrior class, which predominately focused its energies on swordmanship. Many different versions of ju-jutsu exist, but they are all considered more defensive than offensive. For more aggressive attacks, most Japanese warriors would use other forms of martial arts. See <a href="#MAC_2.4">Section 2.4</a> for more information on the development of historical Japanese martial arts.</p>

<h5><a name="MAC_9.3.3.0.2">9.3.3.0.2</a> Nin-Jutsu</h5>
<p><strong>Basic Martial Arts Style</strong> <tt>[30 style points]</tt></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>&mdash;The ancient art of Nin-jutsu covers a wide array of techniques and styles. The focus of the style is reflected in the traditional role of the ninja, who was a trained spy in Japanese feudal society. The ninja used his skills to accomplish his missions, which usually involved spying or sabotage. Nin-jutsu also taught hand-to-hand combat techniques. A ninja was trained early in life to master the many skills required in his training. The first phases of training emphasized balance, mental toughness, endurance, and athletic abilities such as swimming, jumping, and climbing. In later phases, the ninja began to learn to use weapons and practice unarmed combat. Most ninjas were taught the use of the sword, staff, spear, chain, and the shuriken. The final phases of training involved the arts of disguise, camouflage, poison, and map-making. Ninjas were taught to be self-reliant and to act independently over long periods of time.</p>
<p>The unarmed combat of the ninja focused on learning how to deliver punishing attacks to unarmored foes and how to escape capture from more heavily armored guards. Most of the stances and attacks taught to a ninja were very practical and direct. Koppokitsu or bone-breaking techniques were also taught at the advanced levels of training within this martial arts style. See <a href="#MAC_2.4">Section 2.4</a> for more information on the historical development of Japanese martial arts.</p>

<p><strong>Basic Martial Arts Style</strong> <tt>[25 style points]</tt></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>&mdash;The art of sumai is an ancient Japanese form of wrestling that is today known as Sumo. Sumo also relies on close quarter grappling but is much less danger- ous than its ancient precursor. Sumai uses grappling in conjunction with kicking, butting, and striking attacks. The sumai attacks are based on strength and weight rather than many martial arts techniques that emphasize speed and mobility, Sumai is designed to knock one's opponent to the ground where they may be trampled. The martial artist uses his hips and legs to throw his opponent off balance, then immobilizing or dispatching his foe with a small blade slipped into the gaps of the armor. Sumai is practiced standing with an emphasis on wide, powerful stances. See <a href="#MAC_2.4">Section 2.4</a> for more information on the historical development of Japanese martial arts.</p>

<h3><a name="MAC_9.3.4">9.3.4</a> KOREAN MARTIAL ARTS</h3>
<p>Korean martial arts have traditionally focused on empty-handed techniques for fighting. The unarmed fighting systems listed here represent only a small sampling of Korean martial arts. For some more information on Korea, refer to <a href="#MAC_2.5">Section 2.5</a>.</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_9.3.4.0.1">9.3.4.0.1</a> Hwarang-do</h5>
<p><strong>Advanced Martial Arts Style</strong> <tt>[60 style points]</tt></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>&mdash;Hwarang-do is an ancient Korean martial art. It is also a healing art. The original system was conceived by a Buddhist priest and taught to the young members of the royal family and other nobles. Collectively these men were known as the hwarang, their ranks included famous generals and leaders who inspired the rest of the country with their deeds. The name hwarang-do means "way of the flowering manhood" and its members followed a code of ethics that promoted loyalty to country and parents, trust and brotherhood between friends, courage, andjustice. During the Yi Dynasty, the teaching of this art was discouraged and its masters and practitioners retreated to remote monasteries in the mountains to continue their teachings. This continued until 1960 when the first public school was opened in Korea.</p>
<p>The study of this martial art encompasses the development of inner energy through meditation and breathing. The fighting techniques of this system are complex, involving thousands of different combinations. For example, over three hundred separate styles of kicks are taught. More advanced training teaches the use of pressure points and joint locking. The adept of this style also strives to develop his inner energy to increase his awareness of his surroundings. Also important in this martial art is the study of the healing arts. Since the practitioner of hwarang-do is required to have an advanced knowledge of the human body to use some of the advanced attacking techniques, he also studies the ways to heal the body. Herbal medicine, bone setting, acupuncture, and other traditional medicines are taught to the hwarang-do adept.

<h2><a name="MAC_10.3">10.3</a> METHODS OF TRAINING</h2>
<p>The following two examples are taken from actual training methods used by martial artists in ancient China for the development of incredible skills. In ancient China there are recorded descriptions of the training practices followed by martial artists to develop their chi powers, the time required for complete mastery of a single technique could be anywhere from five to twenty years ofcontinuous training. This brief section is designed to give the Gamemaster some ideas of how characters in his campaign might train to develop Chi Powers. The word kung used in the titles of these samples is Chinese and loosely means "method of training." Both of the examples given show ways that characters might develop the <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Chi_Powers:_Distance_Strike">Chi Powers: Distance Strike</a> skill.

<h3><a name="MAC_10.3.1">10.3.1</a> RED  SAND PALM KUNG</h3>
<p>The Red Sand Palm Kung allows the adept to make motions of striking an opponent with his palm from a distance and directly injure his target through the force of the adept's Chi, In most cases, death will result in a matter of weeks.</p>
<p>Initially the training begins with a basin of very fine red sand. The student trains by scooping up the fine sand with both of his hands and closing his palms together while he attempts to crush the grains of sand. The student will practice this exercise for hours every day until, after years of continuous training, the student can cause the fine sand to move without touching it while holding his hands at a distance of several inches. The student would then repeat this training with coarser sand until he could achieve the same results at a distance of roughly one foot. Next the student would replace the sand with small iron beads and follow the same process. After success was achieved with the beads, larger iron balls would be placed in the basin. When a student is finally able to cause an iron ball to jump out of the basin by merely rubbing his palms sharply over the basin, he will have achieved mastery ofthis skill. At this point, the new adept can now focus his power to injure an opponent from a distance.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/10.3.2/ONE FINGER KUNG" -->
<h3><a name="MAC_10.3.2">10.3.2</a> ONE FINGER KUNG</h3>
<p>The One Finger Kung seeks to achieve effects similar to the Red Sand Palm Kung. In this form of training, the student begins by attempting to move a large iron bell by pressing it with one finger. After continuous practice, the student is soon able to make the iron bell move with only the lightest touch. The next goal of the student is to practice this exercise until he can make the iron bell move from a distance of several feet by merely pointing at it with his finger. The final stage of the bell training involves the student practicing until he can cause the clapper to ring inside the iron bell without the bell moving.</p>
<p>The next stage of training involves attempting to extinguish the flame of a lighted candle from a distance often to twenty feet away. When the student can accomplish this feat, a glass lantern with a lit candle inside is substituted for the final phase of training. When the student reaches a level of mastery at which he can extinguish the candle without breaking the glass of the lantern, he will have achieved mastery of this skill. At this advanced level of skill, an opponent can be injured even if a door or other obstacle stood in one's way.</p>

<h5><a name="MAC_10.4.3.0.1">10.4.3.0.1</a> Chi Powers: Falling Leaf [Heroic]</h5>
<p>The character learns to focus the power of his mind to accomplish incredible feats of levitation. A successful static maneuver will allow the character to reduce the severity of a fall by his skill bonus times two in feet. The severity of a fall may never be reduced below that of a 1' fall. A 20% activity action is required the round after the fall to recover (assuming the character is alive and conscious). {Em}</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> If a character has a bonus of +45 and makes a successful static maneuver to use this skill, he may take 90' off the distance of any fall. If the character is facing a fall of 110' he may treat it as a fall of 20' (110-90). If the character is facing a fall of 12', he may treat it as a fall of only 1' (the minimum distance afall can be reduced to with this skill).</blockquote>
<h5><a name="MAC_10.4.3.0.2">10.4.3.0.2</a> Chi Powers: Fantastic Leap [Heroic]</h5>
<p>The character learns to focus his power to accomplish incredible leaps. A successful static maneuver allows the user to leap up to 20' horizontally or 15' vertically. This skill requiresa 20% preparation action in the previous round. {Ag}</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_10.4.3.0.3">10.4.3.0.3</a> Chi Powers: Hold Breath [Core]</h5>
<p>Normally, a character can hold his breath for 5 rounds plus his temporary Constitution stat (not bonus) divided by 10. Thus, a charac ter with a 90 temporary Constitution stat can hold his breath for 14 rounds (or just around two and a half minutes). The character can make a static maneuver to increase the amount of time he can hold his breath. If the maneuver is successful, he can hold his breath up to twice as long as normal. This skill requires a 20% preparation action in the round prior to holding breath. {SD}</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_10.4.3.0.4">10.4.3.0.4</a> Chi Powers: Light Feet [Core]</h5>
<p>The character learns to focus the power of his mind to make his steps light and quick. A successful static maneuver will allow the character to run on snow, sand, or a similar unstable surface without a movement penalty due to terrain. Also, the character can avoid any applicable penalties associated with fighting on these types of terrain. {Ag}</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_10.4.3.0.5">10.4.3.0.5</a> Chi Powers: Lizard's Climb [Core]</h5>
<p>The character learns to climb vertical walls with his back facing the wall. A successful static maneuver allows the user to make a <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Climbing">Climbing</a> maneuver with only half the normal activity required. This skill requires a 20% preparation action in the round prior to climbing, {SD}</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_10.4.3.0.6">10.4.3.0.6</a> Chi Powers: No Shadow Attack [Heroic]</h5>
<p>The character learns how to focus his internal energy to deliver lightning-quick attacks to his opponent. A successful static maneuver allows the character to roll an additional die for initiative. The character may choose which die to use for his initiative roll. This skill requires a 10% preparation action in the previous round. {Qu}</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_10.4.3.0.7">10.4.3.0.7</a> Chi Powers: Resist Elements [Core]</h5>
<p>The character can ignore effects of normal heat and cold through the use of this skill. In addition, the character can make a static maneuver to gain a bonus of +20 to RRs versus magical fire and cold attacks. To gain this benefit, this skill requires active concentration by the character (e.g., a 50% action) while it is being used. The character will expend exhaustion at double the normal rate while using this skill (whenexhausted, this skill cannot be used). Examples of normal ranges of heat and cold that can be resisted through the use of this skill would be walking on hot coals or ignoring the effects of near zero temperatures. {SD}</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_10.4.3.0.8">10.4.3.0.8</a> Chi Powers: Resist Pain [Herioic]</h5>
<p>The character can make a static maneuver to ignore the effects of pain. If the maneuver is successful, the character may ignore any penalties from loss of concussion hits for 10 minutes per point of Constitution bonus (with a minimum of 10 minutes). This skill requires a 20% preparation action in the previous round. {SD}</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_10.4.3.0.9">10.4.3.0.9</a> Chi Powers: Sense Weakness [Fantastic]</h5>
<p>The character learns to sense weak spots in his opponent's defenses. A 40% preparation action is required to attempt to sense the vulnerable spot. A successful static maneuver will allow the character to possibly inflict more damage on a successful attack in the following round. The character may re-roll any one critical inflicted in an attack made in the following round. If the critical is re-rolled, the character must abide by the result of the second roll {In}</p>

<h5><a name="MAC_10.4.4.0.1">10.4.4.0.1</a> Chi Powers: Buddha's Palm [Fantastic]</h5>
<p>The character learns how to focus the internal energy of his body to strike an opponent with this deadly attack. This skill requires a 30% preparation round to focus and marshal the internal energy needed. Upon a successful static maneuver, the character may severely disrupt an opponent's internal energy. If, in the following round, the character makes a successful unarmed attack, his opponent receives a special negative modifier to all Chi Powers and <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Self_Control">Self Control</a> maneuvers. For each level of critical inflicted by the martial arts attack, a special -20 modifier is applied to the opponent (e.g., a 'C' critical would result in a special -60 modifier to the opponent). This negative penalty reduces by 10 points per round after it is first inflicted (to a minimum of 0). {None}</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_10.4.4.0.2">10.4.4.0.2</a> Chi Powers: Continuous Strikes [Heroic]</h5>

<h5><a name="MAC_10.4.4.0.3">10.4.4.0.3</a> Chi Powers: Distance Strike [Fantastic]</h5>
<p>The character learns to project the force of his attacks without making physical contact with his opponent. If the static maneuver is successful, the character may make a normal melee attack with his chosen melee weapon or martial arts attack. The opponent may not parry this strike (but all other defensive bonuses apply). See the chart below for other modifiers. This skill requires a 40% preparation action in the previous round. {Em}</p>

<p>The character learns to summon the power of the elements while attacking. A successful static maneuver allows the user to inflict an additional elemental critical (Cold, Heat, Electricity, or Impact) of equal severity each time he attacks with an unarmed attack. This skill requires a 40% preparation action in the previous round. This skill must be developed separately for each type of element. {Em}</p>
<h5><a name="MAC_10.4.4.0.5">10.4.4.0.5</a> Chi Powers: Fists of Iron [Heroic]</h5>
<p>The character learns how to focus the power of his mind into his attacks. A successful static maneuver allows the user to resolve all unarmed martial arts attacks during that combat round on the Mace Attack Table. This skill requires a 20% preparation action in the previous round. The damage threshold of the Degree being used by the martial artist also modifies his OB (as shown in the chart below). {Pr}</p>

Upon a successful static maneuver, the character's next unarmed attack in the following round will cause his opponent to suffer a debilitating injury. The opponent suffers a special -10 modifier to all skills and maneuvers for each level of critical inflicted by the unarmed attack (e.g., a 'C' critical would result in a special -30 modifier to the opponent). This negative penalty remains for one round for each concussion hit of damage delivered with the attack.

<h5><a name="MAC_10.4.5.0.2">10.4.5.0.2</a> Chi Powers: Invulnerability [Fantastic]</h5>
<p>This skill allows the character to focus his inner energy to resist attacks. The type of attack that this skill resists must be chosen when this skill is first developed (e.g., Edged weapons, Concussion weapons, Unarmed attacks, etc.). The character can harden his body to this type of attack through practice and inner strength. This skill requires taking a 20% preparation action in the round immediately prior to the use of this skill (or during the snap action phase of the same round). Then the character must make a static maneuver. If successful, the individual may half the concussion damage delivered from the attack and reduce the severity of any critical by two levels of severity. If the critical result is an 'A' critical, treat it as an 'A' critical modified by -40 (modified rolls less than zero result in no effect). If the critical result is a 'B' critical, resolve it as an 'A' critical modified by -20 (modified rolls less than zero result in no effect). {None}</p>

This skill requires a special 40% preparation action in the round immediately prior to the use of this skill (or during the snap action phase of the same round). Upon a successful static maneuver, the character may temporarily ignore the effects of any one critical that he has received. The character may delay the effect of this critical for up to two rounds per point of Self Discipline stat bonus (with a minimum of two rounds).</p>

<h2><a name="MAC_11.2">11.2</a> ADOLESCENCE SKILL DEVELOPMENT</h2>
<p>With the advent of many new martial arts skills in this companion, players and Gamemasters may wish to allow a certain race or culture to gain martial arts skills during adolescence to reflect a race's or culture's preoccupation with martial arts. This is acceptable as long as only non-Restricted skills are taken. Remember during adolescence development that characters are assumed to be products of their race and culture and not of their profession. Therefore any martial arts skills granted during adolescent development are representative of the expertise of the race or culture in its entirety. A balanced solution is to allow a race or culture with a high degree of integration with the martial arts to gain martial arts skills as hobby ranks.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/11.5/YOUR ROLE" -->
<h2><a name="MAC_11.5">11.5</a> YOUR ROLE</h2>
<p>It is very important to determine a character's role within the campaign. The ideas presented in this section do not target how to use the rules or skills to your best advantage when creating a character who uses martial arts. Rather, they concentrate on creating good character concepts that will be fun to play campaign. Here are some sample character concepts for martial artists. They are meant to serve as inspiration for player characters as well as non-player characters (NPCs).</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_11.5.0.1">11.5.0.1</a> THE HEALER</h4>
<p>When you first started training in the martial arts, you were interested in learning how to make yourself more powerful. Finally after years of training, you have reached one of the highest levels of accomplishment in your chosen martial art. However, you no longer have the desire to fight others to prove your strength and power. The more you learned about the natural functions of the body and how to heal it, the more fascinated you became. Your master recognized your interest and began to teach you the deeper secrets of the body. Your calm and unruffled demeanor hides a great martial arts talent, but you are more interested in avoiding combat than showing your prowess.</p>
<blockquote id="quote"><strong>Quote:</strong> "I am sorry I had to do that to you but you would not listen. Sit still and I will get some medicine to fix your arm&mdash;at least it is a clean break. Whoever taught you to lunge with a knife in that manner?"</blockquote>
<p>The healer is an interesting type of character concept to play. It couples the aggressive nature of the martial arts skills presented in this companion with an enlightened restraint. This character concept allows for a lot of fun role playing opportunities. Interestingly enough, traditionally skilled martial arts masters were also the local doctors of their communities due to their advanced knowledge of the body.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_11.5.0.2">11.5.0.2</a> THE COWARD</h4>
<p>Since you were little you have always been afraid of others and confrontation. Admitting your fear to yourself, you then set out to become the best fighter you could possibly become. You never act in a manner to give offense, even though your martial arts skills are very advanced. If you are forced to defend yourself, you attack without mercy until your foes have fallen. Most of your opponents do not last long, victims of both your skill and their overconfidence.</p>
<blockquote id="quote"><strong>Quote:</strong> "<whap, whap, thump... thud> Now do you realize that you should have just taken my money and left me alone ? "</blockquote>
<p>The coward is a challenging type of character concept to play. In most cases, it is not a suitable character concept for players, as they will be constantly seeking danger throughout the campaign. As a NPC, this character concept comes into its own and can be a very intriguing addition to the campaign. Having the players trying to maneuver the immensely more skilled but cowardly NPC into helping them fulfill a quest can lead to many exciting role playing sessions.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_11.5.0.3">11.5.0.3</a> THE YOUNG STUDENT</h4>
<p>You have just finished several years of apprenticeship with a demanding master. You have decided to set out to see the world and to use your martial arts skills. You are confident in your abilities, but your confidence is tempered by the memory of how easily your master can still defeat you.</p>
<blockquote id="quote"><strong>Quote:</strong> "Well I had fo follow my master around for three years before he would teach me anything. I'd better be good by now. "</blockquote>
<p>The young student is a typical character concept for martial arts. Since most starting characters will be just learning the more advanced martial arts, this character concept fits in well with the level of skill of the character. This is a very flexible character concept with many possible variations. Anyone choosing this character concept should ask themselves several questions: Did the young student part on good terms with his master? Why is the student deciding to leave the shelter ofhis tutor now? Were there other students of the master training with him? Did the student gel along with them or was there a bitter conflict? These and similar questions will help establish a strong character background.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_11.5.0.4">11.5.0.4</a> THE YOUNG MASTER</h4>
<p>You are a child prodigy of martial arts. You have trained in the martial arts since you were born and have gained great fame as a child martial artist. Now that you are an adult, you have become an accredited master of your particular style over the objections of some who cry that you are too young. You strive to be respectful to your fellow masters, but someone always seems willing to test your "mastery."</p>
<blockquote id="quote"><strong>Quote:</strong> " The young reed bends with the wind, the old tree breaks under the strain. "</blockquote>
<p>The young master is an interesting character concept for martial artists. The player who wishes to use this concept for their character must be willing to invest either background options or development points to make sure that a high level of proficiency in the martial arts is obtained. Like some of the other character concepts presented already, this concept carries within it the seeds for campaign ideas and plots. Perhaps the other older masters of his martial arts style wish to humiliate the character, or they seek to use his youthful naivete for their own ends. In either case, some interesting gaming sessions could be generated from this concept.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_11.5.0.5">11.5.0.5</a> THE STREET PERFORMER</h4>
<p>You are a skilled showman or perhaps a martial artist down on his luck. What ever the case, you make your living by demonstrating your martial arts talents in the streets. If you are skilled, the spectators throw you money. You soon learned that the demonstration of the more showy maneuvers of your style gained greater wealth than other more effective maneuvers. As a result you tend to fight in a showy or flashy way that is disdained by some purists but is still very effective.</p>
<blockquote id="quote"><strong>Quote:</strong> "Allow me demonstrate my humble skills. You will be witness to the first time this daring feat has been attempted since the tragic death of my former master many years ago. "</blockquote>
<p>The street performer is a very interesting character concept for martial artists. The character gets to use his martial arts skills and display his prowess in an arena other than combat. The player should describe what his character is doing to earn his money as a performer, because it can lead to interesting role playing and character development. Players who choose to follow this character concept should also probably receive a more flamboyant description of their character's combat actions during gaming sessions. Interesting plots can develop from this character concept. Perhaps the character wishes to be respected as a traditional martial artist after a time. What must he do to earn the respect of the other masters? Another option could be the existence of a Performers Guild that has secret connections to other organizations and its own shadowy motives. This concept should generate a lot of player interaction within the party as the various players role-play their reactions to the street performer's talents.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_11.5.0.6">11.5.0.6</a> THE SECRETIVE MASTER</h4>
<p>You are the inheritor of a secret style of martial arts. Perhaps it is a style taught by your family or a secret society. You have sworn never to reveal it to outsiders. As a result, you have studied another more common type of martial arts to use in public places. Your secret mastery means that you can never claim the respect and accolades due to a master of the martial arts, but it is a small price to pay for the knowledge you have gained.</p>
<blockquote id="quote"><strong>Quote:</strong> "Now we that are finally alone, l can unleash my Shooting Stars Fist technique? I hope you will be able to appreciate my mastery before you die."</blockquote>
<p>The secretive master is an interesting character concept for martial artists. This character concept may appeal to players who like to have a secret agenda or players who like starting out with the deck stacked against them. It is also can create interesting NPCs for long-term campaigns. This concept allows for a lot of plot development that can be shared between the player and the Gamemaster as they decide why the weapon style or martial arts style is being kept secret. Perhaps it is secret because it is associated with an organization or group of people thought long dead that was once a threat to the established order. Or maybe the style is a secret art of a powerful organization; to accidentally reveal its secrets publicly would result in death for the offender. In any case, this concept lends itself to long-term plot threads as the Gamemaster reveals the reasons behind the secrecy of this martial art. It is important that this concept be honored if a player wishes to develop this type of character. If the Gamemaster does not have the time or the inspiration to weave this plot line into the ongoing campaign, the player is better off using a different character concept.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_11.5.0.7">11.5.0.7</a> THE HEADSTRONG SHOWOFF</h4>
<p>You have never listened lo the words of your master, who always cautioned you to act with restraint and respect. You know that you are the best and you are not afraid to prove it. Those who will not fight you are cowards who fear the public humiliation of being defeated in public. You are a master at provoking a fight, when you wish, to prove your mastery in the martial arts.</p>
<blockquote id="quote"><strong>Quote:</strong> "Your style is as pathetic and weak as you are yourself. I am young and strong and my martial arts skills are superior to yours. If you admit that your skills are inferior to mine, I will not fight you since I was always taught to respect my elders. Well, I await your answer, old man!"</blockquote>
<p>The headstrong showoff is a very dynamic character concept for martial artists. This concept, if chosen by a character, will most likely propel the entire player group careening from one misadventure to another. The headstrong showoff is like a bull trapped in a china closet. If a Gamemaster is running a tightly scripted campaign, this is probably not a wise concept to encourage characters to play. This concept will keep the group involved in the thick of things and the Gamemaster on his toes. An interesting variant to play on this character concept is the showoff who finally realizes that he is not the best. How does the character react to this realization? Does he feel fear, shame, acceptance, anger, etc., and does he change his outlook on life or continue on the same path?</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_11.5.0.8">11.5.0.8</a> THE VENGEFUL STUDENT</h4>
<p>Your best friend or family was killed before your eyes, only you managed to escape a similar fate. You were helpless to save them, as you lacked any combat skills. Since that fateful day, you have sworn to avenge their deaths by slaying their murderers. To reach your goal, you have obsessively trained in martial arts so that you can take your vengeance personally,</p>
<blockquote id="quote"><strong>Quote:</strong> " You killed my family, now prepare to die..."</blockquote>
<p>The vengeful student is a classic character concept for martial artists. This concept provides strong motivation for their narrow focus in the martial arts as well as a strong emotional background to the character history. Good role playing can lead to the other members of the parly taking up the character's quest for vengeance. It is relatively easy for a Gamemaster to integrate this plot thread into his campaign. If the character succeeds in avenging his family or friends, it can be a climactic cap to a long campaign. For the health of a long-term campaign, however, it is important that this character grow beyond this rather narrow concept to a more fully three-dimensional character.</p>

<p>A martial artist learns his skills through intensive training and tutoring. One of the most interesting things that a Gamemaster can bring into a martial arts campaign is the introduction of the methods and resources needed to become proficient in martial arts. Adding this degree ofdetail and information brings depth and verisimilitude to the campaign.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/12.1/FINDING A TEACHER" -->
<h2><a name="MAC_12.1">12.1</a> FINDING A TEACHER</h2>
<p>If a player wishes a character to learn a certain martial arts skill, he must find a teacher to instruct him. The success of finding a teacher depends on the location ofthe character, the local attitude to martial arts in general, and the difficulty of the martial arts skill. For more information on creating cultures and organizations that support martial arts see <a href="#MAC_3.0">Section 3.0</a> and read further in this section.</p>
<p>If the Gamemaster wishes to let random chance determine whether the character will find a qualified teacher, consult the following chart to determine success:</p>
<p>Roll 1d100 (open-ended) and apply the following modifications. Consult the chart below to determine the result of finding a teacher.</p>
<p>Individuals that train a character in the use of his martial arts skills have a very important influence on the character's life. In terms of game mechanics, a player who has a character that specializes in martial arts skills can easily spend approximately 30% to 60% of his available development points each level on his martial arts skills. It is then becomes equally important to attempt to make sure that some of the character's role playing and campaign involvement will stem from his martial arts skills.</p>
<p>Here are some charts to determine some random characteristics about the character's past, present or future martial arts teachers and organizations.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_12.1.0.1">12.1.0.1</a> OTHER DETAILS</h4>
<p>A few other decisions flesh out an organization that teaches martial arts skills. Among other things, the Gamemaster must decide how large the organization is, what are its goals, its structure, and any other interests the organization may have.</p>
<p><strong>Popularity</strong>&mdash;Is the organization popular? Has it recently won a famous challenge from a rival school, or been granted some favor by a powerful figure? Is the organization losing popularity, has it lost an important challenge, or has it been involved in a scandal? Is the organization relatively unknown, is it a secret organization or newly founded?</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> Melissa and the Gamemaster talk some more about the background of her character. Ming Te.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Goals</strong>&mdash;What are goals of the organization? Is the organization serving as a front for another secret organization or clan? Does the organization have political motives? Does the organization serve a religious movement? Is the organization out to simple gain money and political power? Does the organization strive to uphold a rigid moral or religious code of ethics?</p>
<p><strong>Structure</strong>&mdash;What is the structure of the organization? Is it based on a religious order? Is the organization composed of only masters and students? Does a council of masters preside over the organization? Is there a single master of the organization, and if so how is he elected? Is the organization split into several independent branches?</p>
<p><strong>Wealth</strong>&mdash;How wealthy is the organization? Is it impoverished? Is it moderately wealthy with several training halls and many members? Is it wealthy with branches in many cities and access to ready cash? How does the organization raise its money? Does the organization have funding from another source, does it have membership dues, or does it have other revenue generating means?</p>
<p><strong>Advancement</strong>&mdash;How do you advance within the organization? Is advancement through seniority of the student or of the master of the student? Is advancement handled through popular acclaim or vote, and if so who is allowed to vote? Is advancement handled through formal challenges, and if so what are the regulations regarding challenges?</p>
<p><strong>Other interests</strong>&mdash;Does the organization have any other interests besides promoting martial arts? For example the organization could be involved in banking, challenges, providing instructors, providing bodyguards, providing mercenaries, producing duelists, acting as the enforcement arm of another organization, training assassins, training doctors, or providing arbitrators.</p>
<p><strong>Recent Events</strong>&mdash;What recent events have occurred to the organization since characters have become involved with it? Has there been a scandal (political, religious, law, or moral)? Has a split or schism occurred in the ranks of the organization recently? Has the organization had a sudden loss or gain of popular favor, and if so what occurred? Are (here upcoming martial arts competitions that will involve the organization?</p><h4><a name="MAC_12.1.0.2">12.1.0.2</a> MASTER'S BACKGROUND</h4>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/12.2/TRAINING METHODS" -->
<h2><a name="MAC_12.2">12.2</a> TRAINING METHODS</h2>
<p>While there are many historical methods used to help train martial artists ranging from running with weights to leaping in and out of pits or training on top of small round wooden pillars, all of these methods share some common factors. The training method seeks to develop the martial artist physically through exercise, and emotionally and intellectually through sparring and set forms.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_12.2.0.1">12.2.0.1</a> EXERCISE</h4>
<p>Exercise is one of the most important training methods. Martial arts require a high degree of flexibility and strength from their practitioners. Much of the exercise and training methods used in martial arts styles focus on making the student more limber and flexible. Examples in history ranged from lying weights to one's body while exercising to practicing atop of small structures to promote balance, to hardening the body by striking objects repeatedly.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_12.2.0.2">12.2.0.2</a> SPARRING</h4>
<p>Most martial arts styles teach their more advanced students through sparring, or controlled fighting with another student. Sparring allows the student to prepare himself for actual combat in a safe environment. The student becomes comfortable with striking an opponent and being struck to prevent fear from freezing his reactions in an actual combat situation. In addition sparring helps the student understand the reasons and methods behind his martial arts techniques through experience.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_12.2.0.3">12.2.0.3</a> SET FORMS</h4>
<p>Included in many martial arts styles are several set forms (katas). A set form is a predefined series of movements, strikes, and counter-strikes using the martial arts style that a student can practice on his own. The set forms allow the student to gain confidence in his ability and instill trained reactions to certain types of attacks. Through extensive use of set forms, the student can react to attacks without thinking because he has practiced counters so often that they have become instinctive.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_12.2.0.4">12.2.0.4</a> ANCIENT TRAINING METHODS</h4>
<p>The following methods are ancient training methods once used in China for practitioners of the martial arts. It is hoped that these examples will stimulate Gamemasters and players to create their own unique training methods for their martial arts.</p>
<p><strong>Climbing Wall Kung</strong>&mdash;With this training, a skilled adept can with his back against a wall, move freely on the wait through the strength of his heels and elbows. Like a lizard the adept will be able to use the small cracks and protrusions on the wall to scale it. The student first practices lying on his back and moving with only the strength and coordination of his heels and elbows. Then a training wall with protruding bricks and ledges is built and the student practices climbing it with only his elbows and heels. After the student has mastered this, the protrusions are reduced and weight is added to the student's body. After many years of practice, the student will be able to scale a wall with the easy and dexterity of a lizard.</p>
<p><strong>Dragon Claw Kung</strong>&mdash;Dragon Claw Kung strengthens the hands of the adept so that a foe feels as if a talon has struck his body as the powerful fingers of the adept press into him. During basic training, the student attempts to lift a small-mouthed jar by grasping the top with his fingers. At first the jar will slip through his grip, but after several months of training and directing the strength of the forearms into the fingers the adept will be able to easily raise and lower the jar. The next step in the training is to gradually fill thejar with liquid and repeat the raising and lowering process. When the adept has mastered lifting the jar filled with liquid, empty the jar and fill it with sand. Repeating the procedure until this too is mastered, then the adept will gradually fill the jar with lead until he can raise and lower the jar filled completely with lead.</p>
<p>In advanced training, the adept puts the jar aside and practices the same hooking finger grip empty-handed with dynamic tension. Each morning the adept will practice this motion as if he was trying to grasp the sun. At its ultimate pinnacle, "birds flying across the sky will fall as if shot with arrows at a stretch of gripping fingers. Wild horses can be managed as if bridled on the reins in one's hands."</p>
<p><strong>Hing Kung</strong>&mdash;With this training, a student learns to step as lightly as a butterfly. The training begins by filling a onehundred pound earthen vessel with water. The student practices walking around on the edge of the vessel without upsetting it. After this exercise is mastered, the student then ties some weights to his body and repeats the exercise. When the student can step around the vessel withoutspillingadrop,hebeginstolessentheamountof water in the vessel while at the same time increasing the weight on his body. He continues to practice until he can successfully walk around the edge of the nearly empty vessel while carrying weights equal to his body weight. The next phase of the training involves replacing the earthen vessel with a reed basket filled with rocks. Once again the student continues to practice, all the while, removing rocks from the basket until the student can walk around the edge of the empty basket without upsetting it.</p>
<p>In advanced training, the student begins to practice to walk on sand. Using small-grained sand, the student lays down a path one foot deep, three feel wide, and ten feet long. The sand path is then covered wilh rice paper and the student practices walking along it. When the student can walk the length of the path without causing the fragile paper to rip, the paper is removed and the student practices walking on the sand until not even a footprint can be seen.</p>
<p><strong>Iron Forearm Kung</strong>&mdash;The Iron Forearm Kung is one of the simplest training methods to master. The arm training begins by striking the inner and outer forearms against a wooden post or pole. As the arms become stronger, the student can begin hitting harder and for a longer duration of time. After six months of training, the student will begin practicing against a sturdy tree with coarse bark. This portion of the training will continue for two years, after which the student will have gained immense strength in his forearms. The next phase of the training involves hitting smooth rocks wilh the forearms. After the student becomes used to this training, substitute uneven rocks. When the student can shatter rocks with his iron-hard forearms, his training is complete.</p>
<p><strong>Iron Sweeper Kung</strong>&mdash;The Iron Sweeper Kung develops the strength and toughness of the student's legs. The student begins by practicing the low Horse Stance each day, which develops the leg muscles. After several years of strengthening the legs, the student begins to practice low kicks against a wooden post driven into the earth. Each day the student practices leg sweeps against the pole until he breaks it. Another larger wooden pole is driven into the ground, and the student practices his leg sweeps against it until it too breaks. The final phase of the training involves the student practicing against a large tree, until by dint ofcontinual battering he is able to strike the tree with enough force to bring the tree swaying and cause the leaves to fall.</p>
<p><strong>Leaping Kung</strong>&mdash;The student begins by digging a hole two feet deep and three feet wide. Standing in this trench, the student practices leaping out to ground level. Every two weeks, additional weights are added to the body and the trench is dug an inch deeper. After continuing for several years, the adept will be able to leap out of a trench seven feet deep with over ten pounds of weights attached to his body. Then the adept will be able tojump across a chasm or leap to the top of a small building with ease.</p>
<p><strong>Speed Running Kung</strong>&mdash;Initially the adept attaches lead weights to the ankles and then practices running in open fields until winded. The adept will continue to increase the weights on his ankles every two weeks. After several years, he will be able to run ten miles while wearing the weights. Eventually the student will practice running up and down hillsides. After removing the weights, the adept will feel as light as a butterfly.</p>
<p><strong>Water Dividing Kung</strong>&mdash;Water Dividing Kung concentrates strength in the backs of the palms and arms. The adept begins by burying a dozen ten-foot long bamboo poles vertically three feet in the ground. Then the student ties a rope in and around the upper part of the poles, in effect creating a wall. The disciple then starts to practice by pushing both hands through the center of the bamboo row, then spreads him arms outward. As practice increases, a small gap will appear. Eventually the disciple will be able to bend open the bamboo poles and walk to the other side. When this is accomplished, the adept will add additional poles on each side and repeat this training until twenty poles can be pushed apart with ease. Should an unruly crowd ever detain an adept or block his passage, his Water Dividing Strength will have the force to part the mob as an earthquake splits the ground.</p>
<p><strong>Wooden Man Kung</strong>&mdash;The Wooden Man Kung involves practicing strikes against a wooden structure that resembles a man. The student begins by practicing slowly, emphasizing the accuracy of his strikes. As the student becomes more accurate, he begins to strike in faster and more complicated patterns moving around the wooden dummy as he attacks from all angles. After several months of practice, the student will be able to strike the dummy with fast and accurate blows that will become second nature to him in an actual fight with an opponent.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/12.3/REPUTATION" -->
<h2><a name="MAC_12.3">12.3</a> REPUTATION</h2>
<p>An important part of running a martial arts campaign is the role that reputation plays in the campaign world. In the world of martial arts, reputation has carried heavy weight. For example, the various martial arts styles are differentiated by their reputation of effectiveness. A teacher with a good reputation as a skilled fighter will draw many more students than a teacher with a poor reputation as a fighter. Fighters with a high reputation in their martial arts skills may draw more challenges. Reputation allows the character to be known by other martial arts practitioners who may then decide to help or hinder the character based on his reputation.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_12.3.0.1">12.3.0.1</a> REPUTATION IN THE CAMPAIGN</h4>
<p>Reputation should not be measured as a statistic during the campaign. The Gamemaster should keep a rough rule of thumb approximation of the character's reputation in the martial arts. There are several factors to consider when assigning a reputation to a character in a campaign, but the some of the guidelines presented below can make the job easier.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_12.3.0.2">12.3.0.2</a> WHO TAUGHT THEM</h4>
<p>The principle teacher or organization that trained the character in the use of his martial arts skills plays an important role in a starting character's reputation. The starting character's reputation should be higher than normal if he is taught by a teacher or organization with a high reputation, or lower than normal if the opposite case holds true. However, the true measure of a character's reputation is in his actions.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_12.3.0.3">12.3.0.3</a> GAINING AND LOSING REPUTATION</h4>
<p>Martial artists can gain and lose reputation by participating in challenges and tournaments against other martial artists. A martial artist who continually refuses challenges will lose reputation as will a martial artist who indiscriminately challenges opponents. A martial artist who continually wins challenges and tournaments will gain reputation as a skilled martial artist.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_12.3.0.4">12.3.0.4</a> SIGNATURE MOVES, DEFENSES, OR ATTACKS</h4>
<p>Have the player of the martial arts character outline some special signature moves, defenses or attacks that his character is especially skilled at performing. The action does not have to be explicitly tied to a specific game mechanic, unless desired. For example, a martial artist could be famous for his Crossing Fists technique when attacking (<a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Martial_Arts_Strikes">Martial Arts Strikes</a>) or he could be famous for his Arrow Cutting Technique (<a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Deflecting">Adrenal Deflecting</a>). There is a two-fold purpose for having the player do this. First, it offers the Gamemaster some details regarding the character that he can easily work into the campaign, and second it causes the player to think a little more deeply about his martial arts character.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/12.4/CHALLENGES" -->
<h2><a name="MAC_12.4">12.4</a> CHALLENGES</h2>
<p>Challenges occupy an important place in the martial artsworld. Through the mechanism of challenges, martial artists attempt to prove that their particular martial arts style or training is superior to another. Challenges can make the campaign more interesting for players who have created characters that specialize in the martial arts.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_12.4.0.1">12.4.0.1</a> MOTIVATIONS FOR CHALLENGES</h4>
<p>The most common motivation for entering a contest or accepting a challenge is the desire to build up one's reputation. In most cases, a martial artist makes his living through his skill at arms, and success in these types of contests helps to improve his job prospects. Perhaps the martial artist wishes to prove his martial arts style is superior to all others and become a famous martial artist. Challenges can also be motivated by the desire to revenge oneself on a hated enemy by defeating him in a public arena.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_12.4.0.2">12.4.0.2</a> TYPES OF CHALLENGES</h4>
<p>There are many types of challenges ranging from informal duels in the street to very structured tournaments involving hundreds of martial artists. Important things for the Gamemaster to consider are the place of challenges in the society and the rules and regulations that govern challenges. If challenges are illegal, then players run the risk of breaking the law or being thrown in jail by issuing one. A little forethought on the legality and regulations of challenges can make a campaign very interesting. For example if losing in a challenge results in exile or loss of life, characters will be much more wary about offending other martial artist.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_12.4.0.3">12.4.0.3</a> RESOLUTION</h4>
<p>Depending on the situation, challenges can be resolved in a number of ways. A challenge can be until the first blow, first blood, death, until an opponent gives up, or it can also involve the environment (e.g., first person to be pushed out of the ring loses). See <a href="#MAC_14.6">Section 14.6</a> for more information on how to resolve these types of challenges and some ideas for creating interesting challenges for players.</p>

<h1><a name="MAC_13.0">13.0</a> MARTIAL ARTS WEAPONS</h1>
<p>The use and development of weapons has always been linked with martial arts. Certain styles of martial arts may emphasize the use of weaponry more than others, but most martial arts styles have some association with weaponry. The types of weapons used with martial arts have varied wildly, depending on the location and time period in which the martial art developed.</p>
<p>Of all the of the historical martial arts styles of the world, the Chinese martial arts styles are famous for their wide and inventive use of weaponry. One example of a Chinese martial arts style that formulated the efficient use ofbizarre weapons is Choy-Li-Fut which taught the use of the smoking pipe and wooden bench as weapons. Ofcourse, martial arts also encourage the use of more obvious weapons such as the sword, spear, or staff.</p>
<p>There are literally hundreds of different types of martial arts weapons that have been used with various martial arts styles throughout history. Presented here are some of the most popular martial arts weapons, as well as some of the more obscure weapons to inspire the imagination of the reader. In the case where multiple attack tables are listed for the same weapon, the wielder may choose before he strikes which attack table to use on his opponent. In all cases, the wielder needs only to develop a single skill with the specific weapon in order to use it, no matter how many different attack tables the weapon may use.</p>
<p>A common theme among the martial arts weapons listed in this section is their limited effectiveness against fully armored opponents. Traditionally, these weapons were designed to be used against other martial arts masters who wore light or no armor. Many of the unusual weapons listed required great skill to use, and as a result a martial artist using one of these unusual weapons was in effect advertising his martial arts prowess and expertise. Little effort was expended in learning to use very large smashing weapons, as the encumbrance of such weapons did not play to the strengths of a martial artist &mdash; speed and mobility.</p>

If the canceled actions total more than 60% of activity, the character may choose one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Move 50% of his normal movement as a deliberate action.</p></li>
<li><p>Engage in melee as a deliberate action with an additional -60 OB modification.</p></li><li><p>Make a maneuver as a deliberate action modified by an additional -60.</p></li>

<h3><a name="MAC_14.1.5">14.1.5</a> THE ACTIONS</h3>
<p>This is a summary of actions that may be taken in a tactical round.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_14.1.5.1">14.1.5.1</a> ATTACK ACTIONS</h4>
<p>In <a href="5500.html"><em>RMSR</em></a>, the ability of a combatant is measured by his skill in his chosen form of attack. The total of this skill is referred to as the offensive bonus (OB). The entire <a href="5500.html"><em>RMSR</em></a> combat system is predicated on the fact that the OB of a combatant represents the total skill of the individual in combat with that weapon and is available for both offense and defense. Traditionally part of the OB is sacrificed into a parrying action to avoid blows.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A Full Melee attack requires 60% to a 100% activity action.</p></li>
<li><p>A Press and Melee attack or a React and Melee attack requires an 80% to 100% activity action.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If the melee attack is attempted with less than a 100% activity action, a negative modifier equal to the percentage below 100% activity is applied to the attacker's total OB. A character cannot attack with less than the indicated minimum.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A missile attack requires a 30% to 60% activity action.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If the missile attack is attempted with less than 60% activity action, a negative modifier equal to the percentage below 60% activity is applied to me attacker's total OB. A character cannot attack with less than the indicated minimum.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_14.1.5.2">14.1.5.2</a> PREPARATION ACTIONS</h4>
<p>Certain types of skills require a preparation action during the round. A preparation action requires a great deal of mental focus and concentration and as a result, a character is limiled to one preparation action per round. Examples of skills or situations requiring preparation actions include preparing spells and preparing Adrenal or Chi Powers skills.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_14.1.5.3">14.1.5.3</a> OTHER ACTIONS</h4>
<p>Other actions allowed in the round include spell casting, static maneuvers, moving maneuvers, and movement. Please refer to the appropriate section in <a href="5500.html"><em>RMSR</em></a> for further details.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/14.2.1/STYLE COMBAT BONUSES" -->
<h3><a name="MAC_14.2.1">14.2.1</a> STYLE COMBAT BONUSES</h3>
<p>It is very important for the players and Gamemaster to understand in what order modifiers should he applied to skill bonuses, especially when using martial arts or weapon styles, to avoid confusion when using this book, follow this simple procedure to determine the final OB bonus.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose the martial arts or weapon style attack to be used;</p></li>
<li><p>Determine what attack formwithinthe style will be used;</p></li>
<li><p>Take the lesser of the two bonuses (style or attack form) and use this as the OB for the attack action;</p></li>
<li><p>Apply any modifications to this OB due to positional bonuses, environment, spells, items, wounds, or other factors as determined by the Gamemaster;</p></li>
<li><p>This is the final OB to be used for the attack action, which can now he dealt with normally.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote id="example"><p><strong>Example:</strong> Yang Chung, the Fierce Tiger, is a skilled adept of the Leaping Blade style with a total style OB of +85 and a broadsword OB of +110. Currently Yang Chung is fighting a pack of bandits who have ambushed his caravan. Yang Chung is at -20 due to being thrown off his horse when his horse panicked. Seeing a bandit near him, Yang Chung moves to engage his foe.</p>
<p>Yang Chung's player announces he is going to use his Leaping Blade style and attack the bandit who is threatening him. To figure out the bonuses, let's take things one step at a time. The attackform within the weapon style is the broadsword. Since his weapon style OB is less than his broadsword OB, we will use the weapon style bonus as the OB for the attack. Now it is time to apply any modifiers to the current OB. Yang Chung has a special—20 modifier due to being thrown off his horse. He has no special bonuses due to spells, items, or position. Thus the total OB for his attack is +65 (85 - 20). As with any attack action, Yang Chung's player can decide to further reduce his OB by parrying his opponent's attack.</p></blockquote><!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/14.2.2/WHEN IS A STYLE BEING USED?" -->
<h3><a name="MAC_14.2.2">14.2.2</a> WHEN IS A STYLE BEING USED?</h3>
<p>It is very important for the player and the Gamemaster to agree when the bonuses from a Martial Arts Style or Weapon Style skill can be applied. The basic rule of thumb is shown below.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The bonuses from a Martial Arts Style or Weapon Style skill are only considered active if the character is actively attacking an opponent using the style.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The reasoning behind this ruling is simple and direct. These skills are considered a special form of combat that integrates several different types of skills within his attacking techniques.</p>
<p>Most ofthe benefits that can be gained by using a martial arts style or weapon style really only apply to combat, but there are some benefits that can be considered applicable outside of melee combat and may come into question duringplay.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_14.2.2.1">14.2.2.1</a> COMBAT RELATED BENEFITS</h4>
<p>Most of the benefits conferred by a Martial Arts Style or Weapon Style skill can be considered combat related benefits. Examples of combat related benefits include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Lesser and Greater Adrenal Defense</p></li>
<li><p>Initiative bonuses</p></li>
<li><p> Fumble range reduction</p></li>
<li><p>Critical modifications</p></li>
<li><p>Range penalty reduction</p></li>
<li><p>Special Attacks skill bonuses</p></li>
<li><p>Special Defenses skill bonuses</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To further clarify the situation, consider some more examples with the one of the heroes of this companion, Yang Chung, also known as the Fierce Tiger, This character is using the Leaping Blade style, which incorporates Lesser Adrenal Defense, broadsword attacks, and initiative bonuses.</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example 1:</strong> Yang Chung is still embroiled in his life or death struggle with the pack of bandits. If Yang Chung attacks using his Leaping Blade style, he gains all ofthe benefits ofhis Weapon Style skill this round If Yang Chung decides to make normal melee attacks using his higher broadsword OB, he loses ail benefits associated with his Leaping Blade weapon style for this round. This is very clear-cut and as a result it is the easiest situation to adjudicate.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example 2:</strong> Having successfully leaped across the stream, Yang Chung begins to taunt the bandits. Several bandits attempt to duplicate his feat, but they fall short and are caught in the strong current of the river. One bandit, more level headed than his fellows readies his crossbow and aims at Yang Chung who is standing across the river. Yang Chung's player decides it is time to beat a hasty retreat, and decides to have Yang Chung attempt to move awayfrom the bandits towards the sheltering cover of the forest while using his Adrenal Defense skill against the missile attack. Ifthe Yang Chung was attacking with his Leaping Blade style, he could use his Adrenal Defense skill with only a 30% action and he would gain a special +2 bonus to his initiative. Yang Chung's player argues that he should not be penalized in this case simply because he has no one to attack.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Question</strong>&mdash;In the above examples, should the player be allowed to have his <a href="../en.lproj.skills.html#Adrenal_Defense">Adrenal Defense</a> action considered a 30% action?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>&mdash;No. The <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Defense">Adrenal Defense</a> action should be considered a 40% action for the following reason. The Lesser and Greater Adrenal Defense options available with <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Martial_Arts_Styles">Martial Arts Styles</a> and <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Weapon_Styles">Weapon Styles</a> skills allow a reduction in the required <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Defense">Adrenal Defense</a> activity because the style skill allows the attacking action to be combined with the <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Defense">Adrenal Defense</a> action. The <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Weapon_Style">Weapon Style</a> or <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Martial_Arts_Style">Martial Arts Style</a> skill allows for improved coordination between the two skills. In one sense the <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Defense">Adrenal Defense</a> skill is always a 40% action, but certain weapon and martial arts styles allow some part of that action to be incorporated into an attack with no penalty.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>&mdash;In the above examples, should the player be allowed to use his special initiative bonus?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>&mdash;No. The initiative bonus is part of the attacking technique of the style. In a real sense the bonus only applies against the foe that the stylist is attacking since he will be committing the majority of his activity for that round to his attacking action. The initiative bonus conferred by <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Weapon_Style">Weapon Style</a> or <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Martial_Arts_Style">Martial Arts Style</a> skills is due to the elusive positioning and feinting movements built into the system that momentarily confuse and distract the opponent.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_14.2.2.2">14.2.2.2</a> NON-COMBAT RELATED BENEFITS</h4>
<p>Some of the benefits conferred by a <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Martial_Arts_Style">Martial Arts Style</a> or <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Weapon_Style">Weapon Style</a> skill can be considered non-combat related benefits. Examples of non-combat related benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Adrenal skill bonuses</p></li>
<li><p>Other skill bonuses, such as bonuses to <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Missile_Deflecting">Missile Deflecting</a> or <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Evasion">Adrenal Evasion</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>For example if the Leaping Blade style gave a special +10 bonus to all <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Missile_Deflecting">Missile Deflecting</a> maneuvers, this bonus would be active if the style was actively being used. However <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Missile_Deflecting">Missile Deflecting</a> is a 100% activity action in the round it is being used. It would be impossible to attack and use <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Missile_Deflecting">Missile Deflecting</a> in the same round, assuming a normal 100% activity.</p>
<p>In the case of this and related examples, the special bonus conferred by the style is allowed even though the practitioner of the style is not actively attacking. However, the total skill bonus (including the special bonus from the style itself) cannot be higher than the style skill that conferred that bonus,</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example 3:</strong> The Leaping Blade style also offers a special +10 bonus to all Missile Deflecting maneuvers. Yang Chung's player argues that he should be able to use his special bonus to Missile Deflecting, even though he can not also attack with his style this round. The Gamemaster agrees that this is reasonable and calculates the bonus that Yang Chung will receive. His normal bonus for Missile Deflecting is +80. The special bonus conferred by his style is +10, but his total style skill is only +85. Thus his revised Missile Deflecting skill is +85 which is then modified by -20 because Yang Chung fell off his horse at the beginning of the combat and injured himself. Yang Chung can use his Missile Deflecting skill in this case with a +65 bonus (85 - 20).</blockquote>

<h2><a name="MAC_14.3">14.3</a> USING SKILLS IN COMBAT</h2>
<p>This section discusses the use of typical skills that a martial artist will use during combat and gives guidelines for the Gamemaster to resolve any questions that might arise.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/14.3.1/UNARMED ATTACKS AND PARRYING" -->
<h3><a name="MAC_14.3.1">14.3.1</a> UNARMED ATTACKS AND PARRYING</h3>
<p>It is important to note that <a href="5500.html"><em>RMSR</em></a> assumes that martial artists do not suffer any disadvantage in fighting opponents with weapons. A martial artist can parry attacks from weapons without penalty. He is assumed to be able to use terrain, footwork, and body positioning to be able to avoid incoming blows. The same argument also applied to animal attacks &mdash; the martial artist is not at any special disadvantage when parrying animal attacks.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/14.3.2/STATIC MANEUVERS" -->
<h3><a name="MAC_14.3.2">14.3.2</a> STATIC MANEUVERS</h3>
<p>Static maneuvers are allowed within combat situations. The only restriction is that there is a special -20 modifier to represent the added difficulty of attempting a typically non-combat static maneuver that generally requires some concentration during combat. This modifier would also apply to Chi Powers and Self Control skills that are usually attempted during combat. This ruling takes precedence over the first and second <a href="5500.html"><em>RMSR</em></a> printings (this rule is actually errata for these printings).</p>

<h3><a name="MAC_14.3.3">14.3.3</a> COMBAT MANEUVERS</h3>
<p>This sub-section discusses the various combat maneuvers that a character might want to perform in a combat round.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_14.3.3.1">14.3.3.1</a> WEAPON STYLES</h4>
<p>Both Basic and Advanced Weapon Style skill are usedduring a character's attacking action. Only one weapon style at a time can be used in a combat round. The advantage in using a weapon style is that the stylist gains the unique benefits of his style for that round. See <a href="#MAC_14.2">Section 14.2</a> for further discussion on using weapons styles during combat.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_14.3.3.2">14.3.3.2</a> MISSILE DEFLECTING</h4>
<p>The <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Missile_Deflecting">Missile Deflecting</a> skill requires a 100% activity action during the round. While engaging in <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Missile_Deflecting">Missile Deflecting</a>, the combatant is considered to be carefully watching and gauging the flight of all missiles towards him. The difficulty of the <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Missile_Deflecting">Missile Deflecting</a> maneuver is directly proportional to the number of missiles the character attempts to deflect in a given round. If the character has a result, the character loses the benefit of any DB due to Quickness. In the case of an Extraordinary success, the character is assumed to automatically avoid any one attack directed at him this round (choose before results are rolled).</p>

<h3><a name="MAC_14.3.4">14.3.4</a> MARTIAL ARTS COMBAT MANEUVERS</h3>
<p>This sub-section discusses the various martial arts combat maneuvers that a character might want to perform in a combat round.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_14.3.4.1">14.3.4.1</a> MARTIAL ARTS STYLES</h4>
<p>Both <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Martial_Arts_Styles_(Basic)">Basic</a> and <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Martial_Arts_Styles_(Advanced)">Advanced Martial Arts Styles</a> are considered to be used in a character's attacking action. Only one martial arts style at a time can be used in a combat round. The advantage in using a martial arts style is that the martial artist gains the unique benefits of his slyle for that round. See <a href="#MAC_14.2">Section 14.2</a> for further discussion on using martial arts styles during combat.</p>
<blockquote id="option"><strong>Optional Rule [Heroic]</strong>&mdash; Martial artists can attempt to use higher attack forms within their own style. If the martial artist tries to use a martial arts attack with a higher damage threshold than the current martial arts style he is using, he may use the more sophisticated attacking technique with an additional -20 modifier for every Degree he is exceeding the style's limitation. The martial artist is still constrained by his Martial Arts Style skill bonus when determining his available OB.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> Shih Yung, the Stone General is a master at the Iron Robe Advanced Martial Arts Style with a total style OB of +70 and an expert at Martial A rts Sweeping with an OB of +65. While using his style, he wishes to use a Degree 3 Martial Arts Sweeping attack against his foe. Since the Iron Robe style only incorporates Degree 2 Martial Arts Sweeping attacks into its style, Shih Yung will have an additional -20 modifier to his OB. Now Shih Yung's total bonus to attempt this attack wilt be +45 (take the lesser of the style OB and the sweeping OB, then apply any negative modifiers).</blockquote>
<h4><a name="MAC_14.3.4.2">14.3.4.2</a> ADRENAL DEFLECTING</h4>
<p><a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Deflecting">Adrenal Deflecting</a> requires a 60% activity action during the round it is attempted. While engaging in <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Deflecting">Adrenal Deflecting</a>, the combatant is considered to be carefully watching and gauging the flight of all missiles towards him. The difficulty of the <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Deflecting">Adrenal Deflecting</a> maneuver is directly proportional to the number of missiles the character attempts to deflect in a given round, If the character has a large object that would be useful in parrying missiles, the Gamemaster may assign a bonus to the attempt (e.g., a shield might give a +20 bonus and a small pot might give a +5 bonus). In the case of a Failure result, the character loses the benefit of any DB due to Quickness. In the case of an Extraordinary success, the character is assumed to safely deflect the missiles.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_14.3.4.3">14.3.4.3</a> ADRENAL EVASION</h4>
<p>The <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Evasion">Adrenal Evasion</a> maneuver requires a 60% activity action in the round it is attempted. The character attempting <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Evasion">Adrenal Evasion</a> may not have any large objects in his hands or be encumbered while he is performing the maneuver. If the maneuver is successful, the Gamemaster should let the player position his character where he desires as long as it is within 10' from where the <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Evasion">Adrenal Evasion</a> maneuver was attempted. In the case of a Failure result, the character loses the benefit of any DB due to Quickness. In the case of an Extraordinary success, the character is assumed to avoid any two attacks directed at him this round (choose before results are rolled).</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/14.3.5/SELF CONTROL" -->
<h3><a name="MAC_14.3.5">14.3.5</a> SELF CONTROL</h3>
<p>This sub-section discusses the various skills in the Self Control skill category that a character might want to perform in a combat round.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_14.3.5.1">14.3.5.1</a> ADRENAL SKILLS</h4>
<p>There is no penalty for attempting back-to-back Adrenal skills. As long as the player allocates the 20% activity required for preparation time during the round, he may attempt an Adrenal skill during the following round. The roll for success of the adrenal skill in the next round comes at the end of the Deliberate Phase of the current preparation round. Please note that only one preparation action may be taken each round.</p>
<blockquote id="option"><strong>Optional Rule [Core]</strong>&mdash;Gamemasters may wish to add additional restrictions on attempting the Adrenal skills back-to-back (i.e., round-lo-round). This restriction may be justified by stating that these types of skills require a good deal of internal energy to be expended that exerts a considerable strain upon the user if he does not get a chance to "rest". This can be modeled in game terms by adding an additional -10 modifier to the static maneuver for each consecutive round that these types of skills are being used.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong>Shih Yung has performed the following skills in consecutive rounds: Adrenal Strength, Adrenal Speed, and Adrenal Speed. His player now wishes to attempt another Adrenal Speed static maneuver and the Gamemaster informs him that he will suffer an additional&mdash;30 modifier to h is attempt since he has performed these type of skills for the three prior rounds.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="option"><strong>Optional Rule [Heroic]</strong>&mdash;Gamemasters may wish to allow characters to carry the effects from an Adrenal maneuver to carry over from round to round. If the Gamemaster allows this, the character should make a new static maneuver every round (using the Adrenal skill). This skill roll suffers from a special penalty of -10 per round beyond the first round (this is cumulative; so carrying Adrenal Speed to a second round is a -10; a third round will be -20; a fourth round will be -30; etc.).</blockquote>
<h4><a name="MAC_14.3.5.2">14.3.5.2</a> STUNNED MANEUVERING</h4>
<p>A successful <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Stunned_Maneuvering">Stunned Maneuvering</a> skill will allow the wielder to attempt a non-attack action. The <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Stunned_Maneuvering">Stunned Maneuvering</a> skill is declared in addition to the maneuver attempted and is resolved at the start of the Action Phase the maneuver was declared in. The maneuver will take place in the normal initiative sequence of actions.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/14.3.6/SPECIAL ATTACKS" -->
<h3><a name="MAC_14.3.6">14.3.6</a> SPECIAL ATTACKS</h3>
<p>Each Special Attacks skill represents the ability of the character to do something unusual during his attacking action. Most Special Attacks skills are resolved in combat the following way:</p><ul>
<li><p>It is assumed, unless stated otherwise, that the Special Attacks skill is available to all weapons of the same general type listed in the skill description (e.g.. <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Disarm_Foe_(Armed)">Disarm Foe-Armed (Polearm)</a> would apply to all weapons in the Polearm category).</p></li>
<li><p>The character must take an attack action to use his Special Attacks skill.</p></li>
<li><p> If the Special Attacks skill has a higher bonus than the OB of the skill used to deliver the special attack, the Special Attacks skill bonus is limited to the skill OB. This means a character cannot be more skilled with a special attack than he is with the weapon he is using to deliver the special attack.</p></li>
<li><p>If the Special Attacks skill bonus is lower than the weapon OB used to deliver the special attack, there is no modifier to the Special Attacks skill bonus.</p></li>
<li><p>The character may sacrifice some of his weapon OB (up to his Special Attacks skill bonus) to increase his chances of the success of his special attack. This is added to the roll for the success of the special attack maneuver. If the character has any remaining bonus left, he may allocate it between attacking and parrying as normal.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> The Laughing Swordsman, a notorious bandit, has a weapon OB of +65 with a broadsword and a +80 bonus for the Disarm Foe skill. The character decides to disarm his opponent. Since his Disarm Foe skill bonus is higher than his applicable weapon OB, his Disarm Foe skill bonus is reduced to +65. The player decides to apply 30 points of his Disarm Foe skill bonus to his roll to disarm his opponent. The other 35 points are allocated to his weapon attack OB. The player splits his OB into a +25 bonus far attack and a +10 bonus to defense (e.g., a parry).<br/>
The opponent of the Laughing Swordsman is actually Hsio Tung, an experienced arms instructor. Hsio's Feint skill bonus is +80, but his broadsword OB is +120. Knowing the large reward on the Laughing Bandit if he is captured, Hsia decides to attempt a quick Feint to penetrate his defenses. Since Hsia's Feint skill bonus is less than his weapon OB, his Feint skill bonus remains at +80. Hsio decides to allocate all 80 points (the maximum he can) to his Feint attempt of the remaining 40 points ofhis broadsword OB, Hsio places all 40 into defense and attempts a +0 OB attack.<br/>
The chances for success of each maneuver are asfollows: the Laughing Swordsman has a modifier of -90 to his disarming attempt (his 30 Disarm Foe skill bonus minus Hsio Tung's total useable OB of 120). If the Laughing Swordsman succeeds, his opponent will be at his mercy; Hsio Tung has a modifier of+15 to his feinting attempt (his 80 Feint skill bonus minus the Laughing Swordsman's total useable OB of 65). If Hsio Tung succeeds, he will be able to nullify some or all of the Laughing Swordsman's defenses and he will receive a +40 bonus to his weapon OB (he will get half of the points he put into the Feint maneuver back if he succeeds). If either combatant fails his maneuver, he must still attack.</blockquote>
<h4><a name="MAC_14.3.6.1">14.3.6.1</a> RACIAL ATTACKS</h4>
<p>A racial attack is generally considered an Everyrnan skill for the race that use them. Racial attacks might include a tail bash, bite attack, claw attacks, etc. Racial attacks can be incorporated into <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Martial_Arts_Styles">Martial Arts Styles</a> or <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Weapon_Styles">Weapon Styles</a> skills. Treat a racial weapon attack with a Small damage threshold as the point cost equivalent to a martial arts Degree 1 attack and a racial weapon attack with a Medium damage threshold as the point cost equivalent to a martial arts Degree 2 attack. Normally, Racial Attack skills cannot progress above Medium damage (or Degree 2 effectiveness).</p>

<p>This sub-section discusses the various skills in the Special Defenses skill category that a character might want to perform in a combat round.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_14.3.7.1">14.3.7.1</a> ADRENAL DEFENSE</h4>
<p><a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Defense">Adrenal Defense</a> is quite possibly the most important skill for a martial artist to develop. It is nearly the only skill that grants a defensive honus to the wielder, and it is certainly the most effective. The greatest strength of <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Defense">Adrenal Defense</a> is the fact that its bonus can apply to all attacks that the user perceives. Unlike parrying, which can only increase your DB against one opponent, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Defense">Adrenal Defense</a> can increase your DB against many opponents and if the user is also attacking, he may also parry against his opponent as well! This advantage really comes into play is in a combat situation against multiple foes, because his <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Defense">Adrenal Defense</a> bonus will apply against all attackers (as long as he is aware of them).</p>
<p>However, the great strengths of <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Defense">Adrenal Defense</a> are balanced by some fairly serious restrictions. To use <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Defense">Adrenal Defense</a> a character must obey the following restrictions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Not wear any armor (i.e., AT 5 or higher)</p></li>
<li><p>Not be encumbered (i.e., no MMPs from weight penalties)</p></li>
<li><p>Not have a large object in his hands (i.e., hands must be free)</p></li>
<li><p>Be aware of the attacks directed against him (note that this does not necessarily mean "see the attacks")</p></li>
<li><p>Take a 40% activity action (as one of the three allowable actions in a round)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are some further modifications and limitations that apply to <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Defense">Adrenal Defense</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Defense">Adrenal Defense</a> is less effective against missile and thrown attacks. For purposes of defending against missile and thrown attacks, the total <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Defense">Adrenal Defense</a> bonus is halved.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Defense">Adrenal Defense</a> cannot be used against directed spell attacks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The reasoning behind these restrictions on the character using <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Defense">Adrenal Defense</a> are shown below.</p>
<p><strong>No Armor</strong>&mdash;This is an ironclad restriction and should be strictly observed by both the players and the Gamemaster. As a corollary to this restriction, the Gamemaster should not create spells or non-encumbering items that allow the user to gain the benefits of any armor type greater than AT 4. Failure to follow this guideline will lead to imbalance in the game.</p>
<p><strong>Not Encumbered</strong>&mdash;This is another ironclad restriction. This restriction makes common sense, a martial artist cannot effortlessly dodge attacks from all sides when he is carrying a large iron chest or weighed down with many items.</p>
<p><strong>Free Hands</strong>&mdash;This restriction can be bypassed with some weapon styles or martial arts styles that allow the user to wield certain weapons with Adrenal Defense at no penalty.</p>
<p><strong>Attack Awareness</strong>&mdash;This is another important restriction that should be strictly observed. This restriction means that <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Defense">Adrenal Defense</a> does not apply to surprise attacks and ambushes, it does not apply to attacks delivered by unseen opponents, and it does not apply if the senses of the user are obscured.</p>
<blockquote id="option"><strong>Optional Rule [Heroic]</strong>&mdash;The defender can be "aware" of his opponents through other senses than sight if the Gamemaster considers it appropriate.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Percentage Activity</strong>&mdash;The last restriction is that the user must take a 40% activity action to use his Adrenal Defense skill. This restriction can be bypassed in certain situations if the user has the appropriate Lesser or Greater Adrenal Defense option in a weapon style or martial arts style. To qualify for the reduced activity for Adrenal Defense, the user must be using the style to attack during the round.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_14.3.7.2">14.3.7.2</a> ADRENAL REISTANCE</h4>
<p><a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Resistance">Adrenal Resistance</a> can be a very powerful skill if the combatant is suffering from high negative modifiers due to wounds or criticals. The disadvantage of this skill is that injuries can become aggravated due to the lack of ability to discern pain from wounds while this skill is active. In general, if the character engages in vigorous activity (e.g., combat, climbing a cliff face, etc.) while using this skill to avoid the penalties from his wounds, he will run a risk of doing further injury to himself. The higher (he negative modifier of the wound, the greater the chance of aggravating an injury. The results of aggravating the injury should generally be either longer recovery lime or a greater penalty once this skill ceases to be active.</p>

<h3><a name="MAC_14.3.8">14.3.8</a> CHI POWERS SKILLS</h3>
<p>There is no penalty for attempting back-to-back Chi Powers skills. As long as the player allocates the appropriate preparation action during the round, he may attempt the skill during the following round (or during the same round if allowed in the skill description). If the skill is being prepared for the following round, the static maneuver for the Chi Powers skill comes at the end of the Deliberate Phase of the current preparation round. Remember that a character is limited to one preparation action per round.</p>
<blockquote id="option"><strong>Optional Rule [Core]</strong>&mdash;Gamemasters may wish to add additional restrictions on attempting the Chi Powers skills back-to-back (i.e., round-to-round). This restriction may be justified by stating that these types of skills require a good deal of internal energy to be expended that exerts a considerable strain upon the user if he does not get a chance to "rest". This can be modeled in game terms by adding an additional -20 modifier to the static maneuver for each consecutive round that these types of skills are being used.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="option"><strong>Optional Rule [Heroic]</strong>&mdash;The Gamemaster may wish to reduce the penalty to an additional -10 modifier for the static maneuver for each consecutive round that a Chi Powers skill is used.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="option"><strong>Optional Rule [Heroic]</strong>&mdash;Gamemasters may wish to allow characters to carry the effects from an Adrenal maneuver to carry over from round to round. If the Gamemaster allows this, the character should make a new static maneuver every round (using the Adrenal skill). This skill roll suffers from a special penalty of -10 per round beyond the first round (this is cumulative; so carrying <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Speed">Adrenal Speed</a> to a second round is a -10; a third round will be -20; a fourth round will be -30; etc.).</blockquote>

<h2><a name="MAC_14.5">14.5</a> NON-LETHAL COMBAT</h2>
<p>Non-lethal combat can play an important role in martial arts campaigns. The ideas in this section can be used to run challenges between martial artists and simulate sparring practices.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/14.5.1/CHALLENGES AND SPARRING" -->
<h3><a name="MAC_14.5.1">14.5.1</a> CHALLENGES AND SPARRING</h3>
<p>An important part of a martial arts campaign is challenges and sparring between martial artists. The terms of the contest can vary from First blood to death. This section is meant to help Gamemasters resolve these types of contests during game sessions. In the case of non-lethal combat, both opponents attempt to regulate their attacks to not seriously injure their opponent. The terms and conventions of the contest allow both opponents to safely hold back their attacks in order lo avoid seriously harming one another. In game terms, this is modeled by using Subduing criticals instead of the normal critical type indicated by the attack table.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_14.5.1.1">14.5.1.1</a> QUICK RESOLUTION METHOD</h4>
<p>Some challenges end at the first blow or first touch. When the challenge is only to a first blow, consider the first truly damaging blow is to determine the match. Before the challenge, the Gamemaster should determine what level of critical severity would end the match. For the typical challenge, a good choice would be the first 'A' or 'B' critical inflicted on a combatant. Of course, higher level criticals could also be used to determine the winner of the challenge, but the degree of potential damage inflicted by these criticals is more in line with a much more serious duel and thus should be modeled with the detailed challenge resolution method in the next section. When determining the result of a critical delivered in a first blow competition, roll all criticals on the Subduing Critical Strike Table. Comparing the severity of the blow actually delivered against the required level of severity for the challenge can help the Gamemaster describe the results of a challenge.</p>
<blockquote id="example"><p><strong>Example:</strong> Li Chung has accepted a challenge from his rival Sun Wei. The Gamemaster rules that the rivals have a high degree of animosity towards each other so that the challenge will he to the first really punishing blow, a 'C' critical. The first round of combat ends uneventfully, but the second round of combat, Sun Wei open-ends his attack roll and overwhelms Li Chung's defenses, landing an 'E' critical. The challenge is over. The Gamemaster decides that this was an impressive victory, since the severity of the critical was much higher than the challenge conditions. The Gamemaster describes the scene as follows to Li Chung's player:</p>
<p>"Sun Wei stands in the challenge ring, his hands are loose at his sides. He slowly moves into a sloppy defensive position and awaits yourfirst action. Eager to wipe the arrogant look off his face, you move forward to execute an intricate hand strike against him. Suddenly he crouches low, avoiding your strike and executes a twisting leg strike that catches you underneath your chin. Before your body can even hit the ground, two lightning-fast punches strike your chest. You lay on the ground gasping for air. You do not think your ribs are broken. Sun Wei's laughter as he exits the challenge ring echoes in your ears." The Gamemaster then tells the player that his character has suffered 23 hits and an 'E' critical. When rolling for the critical result, the Gamemaster uses the Subduing Critical Attack Table.</p></blockquote>
<h4><a name="MAC_14.5.1.2">14.5.1.2</a> DETAILED RESOLUTION METHOD</h4>
<p>Not all challenges or sparring matches end at the first truly damaging blow. In some cases, the opponents wish to fight until one soundly defeats the other. This type of contest is using "challenge points" to track the progression ofthe contest. A "challenge point" is an abstract method to keep track of the amount of damage inflicted on an opponent. The number of challenge points inflicted on an opponent are computed as shown below.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Each point of damage is considered to be equal to a challenge point.</p></li>
<li><p>Each 'A' critical delivered is worth 5 challenge points.</p></li>
<li><p>Each 'B' critical delivered is worth 10 challenge points,</p></li>
<li><p>Each 'C' critical delivered is worth 25 challenge points.</p></li>
<li><p>Each 'D' critical delivered is worth 40 challenge points.</p></li>
<li><p> Each 'E' critical delivered is worth 60 challenge points.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The first combatant to inflict the agreed amount of challenge points on his opponent is considered to win the contest. The number of challenge points required to win a match also serves a gauge of the intensity of the contest. Once again, all criticals inflicted during non-lethal combat are resolved on the Subduing Critical Strike Table (instead of the normally indicated critical strike table).</p>
<table summary="" >
<tr><th colspan="3" align="center">Challengepoints</th></tr>
<tr><th>Type of Match</th><th colspan="2" align="right">Challenge Points</th></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">Light sparring; first heavy blow</td><td align="right">25</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">Normal sparring</td><td align="right">50</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2">Championship match</td><td align="right">150</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">Fight to near death</td><td align="right">250</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Depending on how closely the challenge point totals between the contestants are when the match is declared over, the Gamemaster can decide how closely matched the opponents were. For example, if a challenge match is declared to be a 100 point match and the final challenge point totals were 110 and 61 for the contestants, it could be said that the winner was clearly superior to his opponent. If on the other hand, the challenge point totals were much closer, the contestants would appear evenly matched.</p>
<p>This abstract method can be applied to other types of situations. For example, in the case of ring matches where the first to exit the ring loses, a total of 50 challenge points delivered in a single round could be required to force your opponent outside of the ring.</p>

<h2><a name="MAC_14.6">14.6</a> UNUSUAL ENVIRONMENTS</h2>
<p>In martial arts movies, the hero and villain usually fight in an unusual environment. Fights can take place on slippery rooftops, as the martial artisls exchange blows and then make daring leaps across the void to the next rooftop or they can take place with the martial artisls running on the heads of spectators, using each head as a stepping place as they move. Fights can also occur in the closed confines of a closet. An elaborate fight could take place in high wooden scaffolding, as the combatants strike at each other and leap to the next level of scaffolding, or more prosaically, a fight can occur on muddy, slippery ground. The possibilities <em>are</em> as endless as the Gamemaster's imagination. The best way to resolve these situations is to plan in advance what game modifications an environment will cause. The following discussions and tables of modifiers are meant to spark the Gamemaster's imagination. Critical results should be modified as appropriate to the environment. Depending on the type of game that the Gamemaster wishes to present, he may adjust these modifications to reflect a more realistic style of combat or he may adjust them to allow for a more heroic style of combat.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_14.6.0.1">14.6.0.1</a> FIGHTING IN RESTRICTED QUARTERS</h4>
<p>Attempting to fight in aconfined or constrained environment is difficult. Imagine trying to fight in a narrow alley or a cramped tunnel with a two-handed sword. This chart gives the Gamemaster some guidelines for modeling these types of situations (the modifiers shown are modifiers to OB). This table purposely does not give fine-grained detail by breaking out all the possible modifiers due to restricted environments. Ideally this table will be used as a guidepost for the Gamemaster to base his own decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Constrained</strong>&mdash;This is meant to model the less than optimal situations for fighting. A constrained environment is an environment where the combatant does not have his normal range of movement necessary for the use of his weapon. As a rough rule of thumb, a combatant needs an open area ofspace around his body with a radius approximately equal to his height to use his weapon without restriction. In the constrained environment, the combatant is limited to one-half to three-quarters of his normal range of movement. Some examples could be attempting to fight in an outdoor setting that has a moderate number of trees and bushes. In urban environments this might represent a room filled with a lot of furniture. Another example could be attempting to fight while knee high in water.</p>
<p><strong>Cramped</strong>&mdash;This is meant to model adverse conditions for fighting. In the cramped environment, the combatant is limited to under half of his normal range of movement. Some examples could be attempting to fight in a small tunnel that does not allow the combatant to stand upright, or attempting to fight while chest high in water. In an urban environment this might represent fighting in a very small room.</p>
<p><strong>Nearly Immobilized</strong>&mdash;This is meant to model nearly impossible conditions for fighting. In the nearly immobilized environment, a combatant has almost no ability to move. An example could be attempting to fight while wedged in a very narrow alley that is barely wide enough for a person to pass through sideways. Another example could be attempting to fight in a very low tunnel that forces the combatant to crawl forward.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_14.6.0.2">14.6.0.2</a> FIGHTING ON UNSTABLE OR SLIPPERY FOOTING</h4>
<p>This section meant to model fighting on uncertain ground, in all of these cases, the melee combatant will suffer the greatest disadvantage because he needs to shift his weight to make melee attacks. Combatants that use thrown weapons or missile weapons will be affected to a much lesser extent because they will not have to adjust their footing as often. Any criticals delivered to a combatant who is fighting on slippery or unstable footing will also do an additional Unbalancing critical. Note that the modifiers shown below are all modifiers to OB.</p>
<blockquote id="option"><strong>Optional Rule [Heroic]:</strong> The Gamemaster may allow characters with the <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> or <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Tumbling">Tumbling</a> skill to reduce the result of any Unbalancing critical by the number of skill ranks they have developed in that skill. If a character possess both skills, he may decide which skill to use.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Unstable Footing</strong>&mdash;This is meant to model fighting on teetering structures such as loose scaffolding or fighting in loose sand. Any critical delivered also delivers an Unbalancing critical (same roll) of two levels less severity. In the case of 'A' criticals, an 'A' Unbalancing critical is given with a -40 modifier to the roll. In the case of 'B' criticals, an 'A' Unbalancing critical is given with a -20 modifier to the roll. If a critical result says that a character is knocked down or falls down, this should be modified as appropriate to the environment. In the case of unstable wooden scaffolding, the character may fall from the structure. All moving maneuvers have their difficulty increased by one column (i.e.. Medium maneuvers become Hard maneuvers, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Slippery but Stable Footing</strong>&mdash;This is meant to model fighting on slick floors. Any critical delivered also delivers an Unbalancing critical (same roll) of one level less severity. In the case of 'A' criticals, an 'A' Unbalancing critical is given with a -20 modifier to the roll. All moving maneuvers have their difficulty increased by one column (i.e., Medium maneuvers become Hard maneuvers, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Slippery and Unstable Footing</strong>&mdash;This is meant to model fighting on a slippery unstable structure or perhaps fighting in very slippery mud. Any critical delivered also delivers an Unbalancing critical (same roll). If a critical result says that a character is knocked down or falls down, this should be modified as appropriate to the environment. In the case of an unstable structure, the character may slip and fall. All moving maneuvers have their difficulty increased by two columns (i.e., Medium maneuvers become Very Hard maneuvers, etc.).</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_14.6.0.3">14.6.0.3</a> FIGHTING ON RESTRICTED FOOTING</h4>
<p>Attempting to fight in an environment where footing and space is limited is very difficult. This case is meant to represent combat that takes place along narrow ledges and small rooftops. This is differentiated from the Restricted Quarters case because the combatants have the room necessary for motion but they do not have the ability to move freelyduetolackofavailablefooting.Inthiscase,the Gamemaster can decide some skills cannot be attempted (Adrenal or Tumbling Evasion for example) and other skills may be at reduced effectiveness. In situations where the combatants are almost forced to stand in the same place because of the environment, any DB due to <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Defense">Adrenal Defense</a> or Quickness could be halved. Any critical delivered also delivers an Unbalancing critical (same roll) of one level less severity. In the case of 'A' criticals, an 'A' Unbalancing critical is given with a -20 modifier to the roll. If a critical result says that a character is knocked down or falls down, this should be modified as appropriate to the environment. In the case of an unstable structure, the character may slip and fall. All moving maneuvers have their difficulty increased by two columns (i.e., Medium maneuvers become Very Hard maneuvers, etc.).</p>

<h2><a name="MAC_14.7">14.7</a> CINEMATIC COMBAT</h2>
<p>Martial arts combat as seen in movies can be a large motivating factor for players deciding to play martial artists in a campaign. The players often create their character with a desire to emulate what they have seen in other mediums. Unfortunately, this natural desire can put the Gamemaster in a slight bind. One of the foundations of the Rolemaster system is realistic and potentially deadly combat. It is difficult to satisfy players' wishes to fight a large number of combatants when the Gamemaster knows that he may end up accidentally killing the player's character through an ill-timed critical roll. This section deals with ways to minimize this problem and ways to run cinematic combat within the <em>Rolemaster</em> system.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_14.7.0.1">14.7.0.1</a> MOVING MANEUVER ATTACKS</h4>
<p>In the movies, martial artists seem to be able to make incredible attacks as they are moving through the air or tumbling towards their foes. Realistically, these attacks are not too probable, but they are fun to try and emulate in a role playing game.</p><p>If a martial artist is making a moving maneuver that takes him near an opponent (e.g., a leaping maneuver or a tumbling maneuver), he may make a moving maneuver attack. The martial artist takes a modifier to his normal attack roll depending on the difficulty ofthe maneuver (see chart below). Unless the opponent can make an orientation roll, he may not return the attack against the martial artist that round. The orientation roll is modified by one degree of difficulty less than that of the maneuver made by the attacking martial artist.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_14.7.0.2">14.7.0.2</a> FIGHTING LARGE GROUPS</h4>
<p>Typically in the movies, a martial artist will take on a large number of opponents and win! This type of action is difficult to model impartially in the <em>RMSS</em>, because one of its hallmarks is combat realism. What is necessary for this type of situation to work is that the Gamemaster must make a determination of the level of skill of the large group of opponents. If the opponents are all relatively unskilled compared to the martial artist (as a measure, if the average OB/DB combination of an individual attacker is less than half that of the martial artist), the Gamemaster can modify the normal combat sequence. If the opponents are all relatively skilled compared to the martial artist, the combat should proceed according to the normal <em>RMSS</em>.</p>
<p>When fighting a large number of unskilled opponents, a martial artist may do one (and only one) of the following each round.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Each strike in melee combat may be considered as being able to attack to up to three unskilled opponents (none of the unskilled opponents may have a rear positional bonus againstthe martial artist unless the martial artist's current style possesses the All-Around Attack option).</p></li>
<li><p>Any criticals delivered are modified by +1 per rank of attack skill used on the critical roll. A result of 100 or 66 cannot be attained this way (treat a 66 as a 65 and a 100 or higher as a 99).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These are powerful options that will allow martial artists to defeat large number of foes with relative ease and should be considered carefully before being allowed into the campaign.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_14.7.0.3">14.7.0.3</a> FIGHTING WITH MAKESHIFT WEAPONS</h4>
<p>Martial artists can attack with makeshift weapons with their martial arts skills. A martial artist may turn a piece of furniture or a ribbon or scarf into a dangerous weapon in cinematic combat.</p>
<p>In game terms, the use of the makeshift weapon can result in a special modifier to the martial artist's attack OB (+5 to +25) with a negative modifier to initiative (-1 to -5) due to the unfamiliarity of the makeshift weapon.</p>

<p>Many of the martial arts styles and weapon styles already described in <a href="#MAC_8.3">Sections 8.3</a> and <a href="#MAC_9.3">9.3</a> can be used in the modern setting with a few minor modifications.

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/15.0/CREATING STYLES" -->
<h1><a name="MAC_15.0">15.0</a> CREATING STYLES</h1>
<p>The first thing to do when starting to create a new martial arts style or weapon style is to try to develop a mental picture of style. Try to imagine how a skilled practitioner of this style would fight. After the concept of the style has been determined, it is time to turn to the mechanics of actually figuring out the point cost of the style. If the style is primarily weapon based, it should he a weapon style. If the style is primarily unarmed combat based, it should be a martial arts style.</p>
<p>The next decisions revolve around the characteristics of the style. If the style is very aggressive, it should include initiative bonuses and in the case of unarmed combat, high damage threshold martial arts attacks. If the style is very defensive, it should include Lesser or Greater Adrenal Defense and other combat options that do not directly relate to attacks. If the style promotes mobility, it should have bonuses for movement-related skills in combat.</p>
<p>If the Gamemaster allows special maneuvers or techniques with a martial arts style, he should follow these general guidelines. Basic martial arts styles should not have more than two special maneuvers. Advanced martial arts styles should not have more than four special maneuvers. When designing a special maneuver or technique keep in mind several points. Special maneuvers or techniques should have some relevance to the overall style and not he included to prop up some shortcoming of the style. If a special maneuver has effects that can substantially affect game play, it must rely on a static maneuver to see if it was performed successfully. If a special maneuver or technique duplicates or improves the effects of an existing skill, it should rely on that skill bonus to determine the success of the static maneuver. Special maneuvers and techniques are meant to help flesh out a particular style, and should be secondary to the actual style skills chosen with the style point system as outlined in <a href="#MAC_9.1">Section 9.1</a>.</p>
<p>It is important that the Gamemaster carefully consider the total style point cost ofthe newly created style. The total style point cost will determine whether the style is considered an Advanced or Basic style, which will have an effect on how easy it is to learn the new style. The total style point cost becomes more important if the Gamemaster is using the optional cultural modifications to martial arts styles and weapon styles as shown in this section,</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_15.0.0.1">15.0.0.1</a> CHARACTER-CREATED STYLES</h4>
<p>If the Gamemaster allows, players can have their characters create their own martial arts style or weapon style. The creation process follows all of the above guidelines with the Gamemaster acting as the final arbitrator for what is allowed in the style. The mechanics for character-created styles are as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The character must know all the skills that the style will incorporate (e.g., if the style incorporates <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Defense">Adrenal Defense</a>, the character must know <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Defense">Adrenal Defense</a>);</p></li>
<li><p>The character must develop 10 ranks in the style before he can use the style. This represents the research and training that he must undergo when creating the style;</p></li>
<li><p>When the character has developed 20 ranks in the style, it can be taught to others and is considered a real style.</p></li>

<h1><a name="MAC_16.0">16.0</a> MORE OBSERVATIONS ON MARTIAL ARTS</h1>
<p>In <a href="5521.html#GL_19.1"><em>Gamemaster Law</em>, Section 19.1</a>, there is a discussion regarding whether martial arts are unbalanced in comparison to other forms of attacks. This discussion illuminates many of the design decisions made by the authors of Rolemaster and deserves close attention by Gamemasters who wish to think further about the role ofmartial arts in the campaign. This section will briefly summarize the main points of that argument and then re-examine the argument in light of the changes in martial arts contained within this companion,</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/16.1/ORIGINAL ARGUMENT" -->
<h2><a name="MAC_16.1">16.1</a> ORIGINAL ARGUMENT</h2>
<p>The original argument looked at the offensive capabilities of the Warrior monk and fighter and compared them at several different levels of development. Examining the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#RMSR_T-5.8">Master Character Table (T-5.8, page 334 in <em>RMSR</em>)</a>, we look at the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> and <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">fighter</a> professions at several levels. The Master Character Table entries were created with the intent of maximizing offense and defense at each level (training packages and hobbies were not used but Adolescent skill ranks were used).</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_16.1.0.1">16.1.0.1</a> THE MASTER CHARACTER TABLE</h4>
<p>At the first level, the Fighter has an OB of 50 and the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> an OB of 30. The <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter</a> has a DB of 30 (shield) and the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> has a DB of 25 (Quickness and <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Defense">Adrenal Defense</a>). It seems the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter</a> has the advantage at the first level with a combined OB/DB of 80 compared to the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk's</a> combined OB/DB of 55.</p>
<p>At the fifth level, the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter</a> has an OB of 95 and the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> an OB of 70. The <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter</a> has a DB of 30 (shield) and the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> has a DB of 74 (<a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Defense">Adrenal Defense</a> is really starting to kick in). The <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> has the advantage here with a combined OB/DB of 144 compared to the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter's</a> combined OB/DB of 125.</p>
<p>At the tenth level, the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter</a> has a combined OB/DB of 152 while the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> has a combined OB/DB of 202! The <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> continues to pull away from the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter</a> as they both go higher in levels. From this analysis, it does appear that the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> is unbalanced in regard to the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_16.1.0.2">16.1.0.2</a> DEVELOPMENT POINTS</h4>
<p>What offsets the Warrior monk's superiority in combined OB/DB? The <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> does not have the advantage of gaining martial arts skill ranks during Adolescent development. In addition the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk's</a> Martial Arts Group bonus is lower than the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter's</a> Weapon Group bonus. This means is that the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> is spending much more DP in order to offset this advantage. On average the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> will spend two to five times the DP compared to the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter</a> to gain his combat skills.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_16.1.0.3">16.1.0.3</a> INTO THE FRAY</h4>
<p>Ignoring (he issue of DPs for now, let us look at a tenth level <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter</a> and <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> squaring off for combat. If the combatants start out at the distance, the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter</a> because of his overall lesser expenditure in DPs for his combat abilities will have skills in a missile or thrown weapon attack. The <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> will suffer a penalty to his <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Adrenal_Defense">Adrenal Defense</a> trying to defend against these attacks. In this case, the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter</a> manages to inflict some preliminary damage before the melee combat begins.</p>
<p>Let us assume however that the combatants start nose to nose. Who will win this battle? The <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter</a> has the edge in concussion damage, as nearly all weapons can inflict 30 points of damage against an unarmored foe. The average martial arts attack will inflict 10 concussion points of damage against an armored foe. (Assuming of course that the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> is unarmored in order to take advantage of his superior <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Defense">Adrenal Defense</a> and the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter</a> is armored because it would be foolish not to) The <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter</a> appears to be ahead here, as he can inflict enough damage on the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> to take him into penalties due to concussion points damage. Most weapons inflict their first critical against unarmored foes at 85 whereas most martial arts attacks inflict their first critical at 103 versus armored foes. But the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monl">Warrior monk's</a> combined OB/DB total is on average 50 points higher than the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter's</a>, this means that the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> will on average inflict more criticals compared to the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> appears as more effective in combat by a slim margin. If the combat can last for more than several rounds, the edge will start to go to the Fighter as the concussion damage mounts against the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a>.</p>
<p>In the case of a battle with multiple foes, the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> is much more effective than the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter</a> because his <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Defense">Adrenal Defense</a> bonus can be used against multiple foes. The <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter</a> is limited to using his shield and parrying against the opponent he is attacking. A <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> will suffer much less damage on average against multiple opponents than the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter</a> because of the <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Defense">Adrenal Defense</a> skill.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_16.1.0.4">16.1.0.4</a> OTHER TYPES OF OPPONENTS</h4>
<p>The <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> has other weakness against other types of opponents and situations. If a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> is taken by surprise, his <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal-Defense">Adrenal Defense</a> offers no protection and attacks against him if successful will be very deadly. Unlike the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter</a>, the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> has no armor to protect him if his defense fails.</p>
<p>In addition, the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> is much more vulnerable to animal attacks which tend to attack the upper torso. Examination of the Animal Attack Tables will reveal that AT 1 is the worst armor type to have against animal attacks by a large margin.</p>
<p>When facing Undead, the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> has several problems. First his specialization in martial arts has probably left him without a serious long range attack, so he will have to close with the Undead creatures. In addition, most Undead require a magical weapon to strike them.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_16.1.0.5">16.1.0.5</a> BONUS ITEMS</h4>
<p>The above point is important regarding magical bonus items and <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monks</a> is important enough to be repeated. There are not very many magical items to improve a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk's</a> combat abilities, unlike that of the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter</a>,</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/16.2/CORE RULES" -->
<h2><a name="MAC_16.2">16.2</a> CORE RULES</h2>
<p>How do things change after the inclusion of the core rules from the <em>Martial Arts Companion</em>?</p>
<p>With the advent of the core rules, several things change drastically for the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a>. The most important changes are the redefinition of both <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Defense">Adrenal Defense</a> and martial arts attacks. <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Defense">Adrenal Defense</a> is no longer a "free" skill in the sense that the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> must state that he is using <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Defense">Adrenal Defense</a> which will take 40% of his available activity during the combat round. It is important to remember that if the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> decides to attack as well as use this skill, then his OB will be modified negatively by this division of concentration per the standard rules of RMSR. The unified martial arts attacks skills significantly reduce the overall development point cost for the martial artist who wishes to specialize in unarmed attacks.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_16.2.0.1">16.2.0.1</a> THE MASTER CHARACTER TABLE</h4>
<p>Looking above at our previous discussion, at the first level the combination of OB/DB for the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter</a> remains at 80 while the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk's</a> drops to a meager 15 (it is 45 if the martial artist does not use <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Defense">Adrenal Defense</a>!). At fifth level the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> begins to gain back some ground, the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter's</a> total OB/DB combination is 125 and the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk's</a> total OB/DB combination is 104. It is still not even, but it is beginning to approach parity. At tenth level, the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> again surpasses the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter's</a> with a combined OB/DB total of 162 to the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter's</a> combined OB/DB total of 152. At higher levels, the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> continues to pull away slowly from the Fighter though at a slower rate.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_16.2.0.2">16.2.0.2</a> DEVELOPMENT POINTS</h4>
<p>This change would seem to make the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter</a> ascendant over the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> except for another important change. Martial arts attacks have been changed and incorporated in one skill instead of four separate skills for each type of martial arts attack. The <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> now has more development points available per level, but this is somewhat balanced by the need lo develop a Martial Arts Style skill in order to become an effective unarmed combatant.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_16.2.0.3">16.2.0.3</a> INTO THE FRAY</h4>
<p>Let us again examine the combat between the tenth level <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> and <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter</a>. If the combatants again start off at a distance, the edge still goes to the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter</a> but it is a smaller edge. The missile or thrown weapon attacks still greatly reduce the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk's</a> <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Defense">Adrenal Defense</a> bonus, but the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> has greater versatility due to his lessened expenditure of development points. The <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> can respond with a missile or thrown weapon attack of his own or he can utilize specialized defense maneuvers like <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Deflections">Adrenal Deflections</a> to increase his defense against the missile or thrown weapon attacks. While both of these options were available to a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> created with <a href="5500.html"><em>RMSR</em></a>, they probably would not have been valid options due to the high development point expenditure required for the melee combat skills.</p><p>Let us again examine the two combatants once they arrive in melee combat. The <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter</a> still has the edge in armor protection. In addition, the reduction of the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk's</a> combined OB/DB has put the two professions in relative parity. In this case, the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter</a> seems to win out with the clear edge in concussion damage and at least parity in critical infliction with the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a>.</p>
<p>What balances this seeming disparity is the inclusion of the <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Martial_Arts_Style">Martial Arts Style</a> skills. Certain <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Martial_Arts_Style">Martial Arts Style</a> skills can allow the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> to use his <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Defense">Adrenal Defense</a> as a 10% activity rather than a 40% activity. This results in the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> gaining a additional 30 points in his OB/DB combination. In addition, a <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Martial_Arts_Style">Martial Arts Style</a> skill can allow the Warrior monk to gain special bonuses in combat such as an initiative bonus or bonus to certain combat-related skills while using his style. It is important lo remember that the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter</a> may also choose to specialize in <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Weapon_Style">Weapon Style</a> skills that offer some of the same advantages if he desires.</p>
<p>The other points made in the original <a href="5521.html"><em>Gamemaster Law</em></a> argument regarding other types of opponents and bonus items remain valid.</p>

<h2><a name="MAC_16.3">16.3</a> HEROIC RULES</h2>
<p>If Heroic rules and options are used, how much docs the play balance shift?</p>
<p>With the inclusion of the Heroic rules and options, the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> gains the benefit of specialized training packages and background options during character creation. Because the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter</a> also gains these options, play balance remains unaltered. The <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> also gains the benefit of special maneuvers with certain <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Martial_Arts_Style">Martial Arts Style</a> skills that allow him to gain short-term advantages in the combal round.

The <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> now has access to Chi Powers skills and Cinematic combat options that he can use to his full advantage. The <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter</a> will also have access to these skills and options, but he will have to expend much more effort than the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior monk</a> to be effective at them.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5602/17.0/THE TRAINING PACKAGES" -->
<h1><a name="MAC_17.0">17.0</a> THE TRAINING PACKAGES</h1>
<p>This section deals with the new training packages and new training package options that are available to characters. For the basic rules for training packages see the <a href="5500.html"><em>RMSR</em></a>. Shown below are the new options available for training packages.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_17.0.0.1">17.0.0.1</a> PROFESSIONAL QUALIFIERS</h4>
<p>The idea behind this concept is that certain training packages should be easier to learn if the character meets certain qualifications. The result is a reduced cost (and sometimes time) for developing the training package. The professional qualifiers needed for each training package (if any) are listed in the description of the training package. If a characler does not meet the slandards for the professional qualifier, he may still learn the training package but he must pay the full price for it. When a professional qualifier is shown, the associated discount to the cost of the training package is also shown.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_17.0.0.2">17.0.0.2</a> LIFESTYLE SKILLS</h4>
<p>Lifestyle skills are a new concept introduced in this book. Lifestyle skills allow a character to develop certain specific skills to a higher level of expertise than normally possible with training packages. Only certain lifestyle training packages can offer this benefit. Examples of training packages using lifestyle skills in this companion are the <a href="../en.lproj/trainingpackages.html#CHI_MASTER">Chi Master</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/trainingpackages.html#WEAPON_MASTER">Weapon Master</a>, and <a href="../en.lproj/trainingpackages.html#TEMPLE_MONK">Temple Monk</a> lifestyle training packages. When a skill is designated as being a "lifestyle" skill in a training package, that skill may be taken as high as 15 ranks by the training package (rather than the normal limit of 10 ranks).</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_17.0.0.3">17.0.0.3</a> NOTES FOR MODERN OR PULP GENRE</h4>
<p>If the Gamemaster is running a Modern or Pulp era, only certain things from each of the training packages are applicable. The Gamemaster should examine each training package and decide upon its appropriateness to the genre he is running. For example, if running in a modern game, all references to magical skills should be ignored. In certain cases, a training package may award ranks in a skill that the Gamemaster is not using in his game. If this is the case, the Gamemaster should feel free to adjust the cost of the TP down by approximately 1 point per skill rank that is not awarded.</p>

Most martial arts opera performers begin their apprenticeship at the age of six and continue in their profession the rest of their lives.</p>

<h2><a name="MAC_17.12">17.12</a> MARTIAL ARTS STREET PERFORMER (V)</h2>
<p>The martial arts street performer is a character who uses his martial arts skills to gain money from spectators. He has a glib and agile tongue that often appears more skill ful than his martial arts skills. The martial arts street performer is also looked down upon by "more serious" (and wealthier) practitioners of the martial arts world. Yet one must cat, and it is honest work. Sometimes the performer is a martial artist who has fallen on hard times and is without patronage. Thus it can be very dangerous to bait inept street performers, as they may be skilled martial arts students new to their trade who will bitterly resent any slur on themselves and their newfound situation in life.</p>

<h2><a name="MAC_21.1">21.1</a> CHARACTER CONVERSION</h2>
<p>If you want to convert characters from the <a href="5500.html"><em>RMSR</em></a> to the new rules from the <em>Martial Arts Companion</em>, the best advice is to "re-create" the character from scratch. Converted characters will not be as effective as characters created from scratch, but if you want a fast way to convert, follow these guidelines for a quick and painless upgrade to <em>Martial Arts Companion</em>!</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_21.1.0.1">21.1.0.1</a> STEP 1</h4>
<p>If the character has any skill ranks in <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Martial_Arts_Strikes_Degree_1">Martial Arts Strikes Degree 1</a> or <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Martial_Arts_Sweeps_Degree_1">Martial Arts Sweeps Degree 1</a>, take the skill ranks and move them to <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Martial_arts_striking">Martial Arts Striking</a> or <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Martial_Arts_Sweeping">Martial Arts Sweeping</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="MAC_21.1.0.2">21.1.0.2</a> STEP 2</h4>
<p>If the character has any skill ranks in the following skills (which are no longer used), he may use the development points that he spent developing these skills to develop other skills in the Martial Arts skill group.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Martial_Arts_Strikes_Degree_2">Martial Arts Strikes Degree 2</a></li>
<li><a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Martial_Arts_Sweeps_Degree_2">Martial Arts Sweeps Degree 2</a></li>
<li><a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Martial_Arts_Strikes_Degree_3">Martial Arts Strikes Degree 3</a></li>
<li><a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Martial_Arts_Sweeps_Degree_3">Martial Arts Sweeps Degree 3</a></li>
<li><a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Martial_Arts_Strikes_Degree_4">Martial Arts Strikes Degree 4</a></li>
<li><a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Martial_Arts_Sweeps_Degree_4">Martial Arts Sweeps Degree 4</a></li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="MAC_21.1.0.3">21.1.0.3</a> STEP 3</h4>
<p>If the character has any ranks in any <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Special_Defense">Special Defense</a> skills, a small number of development points will be available since the total cost for these skills has been reduced for all professions. Figure the difference between the old cost and the new cost and then multiply by the number of ranks the character has in these skills. This is the total number of extra development points that the character will have available.</p>
<p>The character should spend these bonus development points in martial arts related skills, subject to the following guidelines.</p>
<ul>
<li>The normal rules for development must be followed just as if the character had attained a level (i.e., if a skill costs 2/6, it will cost 8 DPs to get two new ranks in that skill).</li>
<li>Any modifiers for Everyman, Occupational, or Restricted skills are applied normally.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="MAC_21.2">21.2</a> MODErN CHARACTERS</h2>
<p>The rules presented in this book will work fine for using martial arts in the modern (or pulp) genres. However, it is suggested that the two new professions not be used in either of these genres, The new training packages may be used (with the GM's discretion), but certain skills may or may not be appropriate.</p>
<p>The Core rules from this book will apply to all modern and pulp genre characters. The heroic rules will probably work fine in most games (though the GM should examine them carefully). The fantastic rules should probably be left out (though the GM should examine them to see if they fit any flavor issues that might be appropriate). Other than that, all rules from this book apply to modern characters.</p>
