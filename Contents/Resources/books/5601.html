<h1><a name="TC_0.0">0.0</a> WELCOME TO THE COMPANION</h1>
<h5><a name="TC_0.0.0.0.1">0.0.0.0.1</a> Introduction</h5>
<p>Welcome to <em>Treasure Companion</em>! Before you undertake the task offiguring out how to assimilate what is found within this tome into your game, a few words of caution and warning are appropriate.</p><p>This companion is "theme" oriented. That is, everything within this book centers around a single theme (in this case&mdash;<span id="arcane">Arcane</span> magic). If the concept presented in this theme is not appropriate to your game, do not use it! Do not presume that what is written upon these pages is law in the strictest sense. Instead, think of it as a text book from which you will learn how to incorporate certain new concepts into your game. It is possible that what you learn here will contradict the things that you want to pursue in your game. Remember that when anything is in doubt, you (the GM) and your game take precedence&mdash;not the rules.</p>
<p>The <em>Treasure Companion</em> is optional&mdash;everything within it is optional (the professions, etc.). As a GM, you must study what we present here and decide if the concepts are appropriate to your gaming world. Adopting the: contents of this book into your game will change the power balance in your game. You (as the GM) must decide ifthis is good or bad for your game. Because this companion is theme oriented, you will probably either adopt the theme (i.e., the whole book), or only adopt a very few select pieces of it. If you only adopt select pieces of it (as opposed to the whole thing), be very careful when meshing it with the rest of the <em>RMSS</em>; all play-balance put into this book presumes that the whole book is being used (excluding one part might be excluding a balancing factor). In the end, the GM (not the players) must decide to usc (or not use) the material present herein.</p>
<p>Players should keep the above discussion in mind when reading <em>Treasure Companion</em>; the GM may decide that this theme is not appropriate for his game. Pressuring the GM to adopt pieces of this tome might not only result in a fracturing of a delicate game balance, but could weaken or undermine his concepts for the world he has created. On the other hand, the GM has an obligation to his players to make clear what the physical laws of his world entail (i.e., the game mechanics). Of course, there are always physical laws that are being discovered. A GM must strive to be consistent in his decisions and in his interpretations of the rules (this includes decisions about which rules to include and which to exclude). Without consistency, the players will eventually lose trust and confidence in the GMs decisions and his game. When this happens, a game loses much of its pleasure and appeal.</p>

<h1><a name="Part_I">Part I</a> CONCEPTS AND PROMISES</h1>
<p>This part of the <em>Treasure Companion</em> discusses the concepts and premises behind wealth in a campaign. Every GM should read this section thoroughly before introducing any other elements from this book into his game (as ideas and concepts provide the strong foundation for the introduction of any new element into a game).</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/1.0/INTRODUCTION" -->
<h1><a name="TC_1.0">1.0</a> INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>Welcome to the <em>Treasure Companion</em>. This book is designed to allow GMs to quickly generate normal and magical treasures to be discovered and won by the characters in their games. Inside you will find optional rules that allow for greater detail in the kind and substance of the treasures that are found. In addition, it includes complete rules for Alchemy in <em>Rolemaster the Standard System (RMSS)</em>. It contains discussions of medieval economics, and the effects of money and magic on the lives of people dwelling in a fantasy world, including guidelines for the buying and selling of the items' characters might find. The <em>Treasure Companion</em> will not be just a useful supplement; it will allow you to incorporate greater realism and detail into your campaigns.</p>
<p>Like any gaming supplement, the <em>Treasure Companion</em> was written with a variety of assumptions. To help you mold the material in this book to your gaming world (or mold your gaming world to these concepts), these assumptions are explicitly stated (as much as possible). This allows you to see what was intended and for which worlds this book is directly applicable. Suggestions will also be given throughout the work as to how the rules might be modified to fit different types of worlds.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/1.1/ASSUMPTIONS" -->
<h2><a name="TC_1.1">1.1</a> ASSUMPTIONS</h2>
<p>The first set of assumptions has to deal with the value of money. These assumptions were used to create the treasure charts (and the optional rules detailing such areas as gems,jewelry, etc.).</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The world uses the prices and monetary system from the <em>RMSS</em></strong>&mdash;There are actually two exceptions to this assumption. The first exception to this rule is that aluminum has been added as a coin type at a ratio of 100 aluminum to the gold. This, technically, pushes the value to the mithril piece to 1000 gold. The second change, however, has to do with the way in with mithril items (including coins) are worked. This book assumes that all mithril items require they be crafted using both a Work Mithril spell and a <em>Weapon V</em>, <em>Armor V</em>, or <em>General V</em> spell (see <a href="#TC_7.0">Sections 7.0</a> and <a href="#TC_9.0">9.0</a> for more information on the creation of items and the nature of enchanted substances). Because of the cost in creating such an item, this places the value of a mithril coin at up to 135,000 gold pieces. Because one could construct a +25 weapon for the same price, such coins are not used for actual mercantiling, but rather created as gifts between heads of state.</p>
<p>The main effect this has to fix the value of the various metals. As stated in the <em>RMSS</em>, the weight of a coin is one quarter of once. Because the value of the coin is based upon the value of its metal content, this fixes the value of a pound of the various metals (see the chart below). The value of a pound of metal will become important for determining the weight of jewelry (see <a href="#TC_14.0">Section 14.0</a>). If you are using a different coinage weight (e.g., one tenth of one ounce per coin), you will need to adjust the formulas found in <a href="#TC_9.0">Section 9.0</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The income of the average peasant is 4 copper a day</strong>&mdash;This is assumed to be either in the form of wages or the profit from a business. Most of this money is not actually going to be in the form of coinage, but will be in the form of assets such as a place to sleep, meals, goods, etc. This does not sound like a lot of money, but is more than substantial to pay for food, clothing, and lodging for the average peasant family. After all, the average peasant farmer does not have to pay the inflated prices for food and lodging that an adventuring PC does; his wife generally handles the cooking and sewing (which saves an enormous amount of money), his children help in the fields, etc. This leaves enough money for the occasional luxury and a pint or two at the local inn, maybe a new suit of cloths for one or two of his children each year, and allows money to be set aside to pay dowries for the daughters. Assuming a 365 day year the average peasant will eam 14 silver, 6 bronze, in a year (slightly less if the peasant does not work every day of the year).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The world uses a "silver based" economy</strong>&mdash;This means that the most commonly found and used coin of the precious metals (silver, gold, platinum, aIuminum, mithril, etc.) is silver. There are two reasons for this. The first is that the wage of the average peasant is such that he will generally not be dealing in coins greater in value than the occasional bronze piece (one denomenation lower than silver). As such, there is likely to be a far greater amount of tin, copper, and bronze coins availlable than there would be of silver and the other precious metals. Gold coins are simply too valuable to be regularly used by the peasantry. There are generally far more peasants than gentry, and this means that there will be many more coins that the peasants will be likely to use and have (even considering that peasants generally do not use a lot of coinage), than there would be of more valuable coins.</p>
<p>The second reason ican be found on the equipment price lists found in the <em>RMSS</em>. If these lists are examined, it becomes obvious that there are very few items whose prices are found in gold. This indicates an economy where gold is scarce and where most transactions are worked out in coinage of baser metals.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The second set of assumptions have to deal with the nature of Alchemy. This work has been written by first defining how Alchemy works in the <em>RMSS</em> and then using these rules to produce the items found in this book. Items are categorized not by such terms as Potent or Most Potent (as has been common in previous supplements dealing with this subject) but by the highest level spell necessary for their creation. In generating the treasure charts for magical items, some assumptions about the gaming world were made.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>There are more low level Alchemists than there are high level Alchemists</strong>&mdash;While this may seem obvious, the point is valid (and sometimes overlooked). There are more students of the craft than there are masters. Many more students, in fact, because most will not have the dedication to reach high levels. Many will either loose interest or peak in their ability at relatively moderate levels.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>There are more low level items created than there are high level items created</strong>&mdash;This assumption follows from the last one. If there are more low level Alchemists than high level Alchemists, more items oflow level can be created than high level ones. This also takes into account the time and materials costs of the items. For example, it is simply more time consuming and expensive to create a 10<sup>th</sup> level item than a 5<sup>th</sup> level item. Also, more people are in a position to afford the cost of a 5<sup>th</sup> level item. Because more people can afford them, 5<sup>th</sup> level items are more likely to be made than those of a higher level.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Alchemists generally do not produce items, except for their own use, on anything but a commission basis</strong>&mdash;Magical items are very expensive and take weeks, ifnot years, to produce. Consequently, they generally need someone to fund their research. Not only do they have expensive equipment, rare substances, and arcane materials to purchase for their items, but they also have servants to pay, food to buy, and all the other needs that normal people have. Given a choice, if they lack such a patron, there is little incentive to spend the time or energy creating items, especially high level ones, that they have no direct use for on the off chance a buyer may be found.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If these assumptions do not sound like the world that you are running, do not worry. Plenty of suggestions may be found throughout this book as to how the rules presented can be modified so that they can more closely match your own world.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/1.2/CHANGES TO PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF ALCHEMY" -->
<h2><a name="TC_1.2">1.2</a> CHANGES TO PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF ALCHEMY</h2>
<p>This brief introduction is designed to highlight the changes (from previous editions of <em><strong>Rolemaster</strong></em>) to the Alchemist profession, item creation, and Alchemy Base spell lists.</p>
<p>The Alchemist is now a pure spell user that can be of any realm. This change was made to allow for the effects of race in <em>RMSS</em>. In previous editions of the rules (where Alchemists were strictly <span id="essence">Essence</span> users), certain races such as <a href="../en.lproj/races.html#Dwarves">Dwarves</a> could be Alchemists while suffering little from the effect of their race (they had a penalty to their Empathy stat bonus, but that was about it). However, in the <em>RMSS</em>, these races would suffer greatly (because of power point progression). To remedy this, Alchemy has been extended to all realms. If this view does not fit a particullar GM's conception of the Alchemist, he should feel free to impose whatever limits are needed to make it fit his world. He may wish , for example, to allow <a href="../en.lproj/races.html#Dwarves">Dwarves</a> to be the only <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Channeling-based_Alchemist"><span id="channeling">Channeling</span>-based Alchemists</a>, or perhaps only <a href="../en.lproj/races.html#Humans">Humans</a> can be <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Mentalist-based_Alchemist"><span id="mentalism">Mentalist</span>-based Alchemists</a>.</p>
<p>The section on cost of magical items has now been extended to include material cost. These costs apply to all spell users regardless of realm. Some GMs may wish to waive some of these costs if they feel that certain costs do not fit the structure of their world.</p>
<p>These new spell lists are based on both the lists in older editions of <a href="5522.html"><em>Spell Law</em></a> and the <em>Alchemy Companion</em>, and much thanks goes to the original authors of these lists. Alterations to these lists have been made to allow for greater continuity of magical item creation. Every effort has been made to retain the majority of the spells at the levels they have previously been presented to make the new lists easy to adapt. All Alchemist Base spell lists stop at 50<sup>th</sup> level. Spells beyond 50<sup>th</sup> level are presented in the section on Divine magic, though these spells are not generally available to mortal mages.</p>
<p>For specific changes, there are a few. There is now more than one version of the <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html#SL_9.1.1">Enchanting Ways</a> spell list. Each realm has a list that deals with the creation of armor, one that deals with the creation of general items, and one that handles the creation of weapons. Though all of these lists have a variety of differences there are some commonalties. The <em>Weapon</em> and <em>Armor</em> spells now include the requirement of certain material compositions. For example, the <em>Weapon II</em> spell, which yields a +10 bonus, requires the Alchemist start with a material that has a +5 bonus due to material composition. General items do not have similar requirements, which justifies their higher levels on the list (compared to the <em>Weapon</em> and <em>Armor</em> spells). Also, multipliers require a <em>General</em> spell of 1 category higher than the multiplier value (e.g., a x2 multiplier requires a <em>General III</em>, a x3 requires a <em>General IV</em>, a x4 requires a <em>General V</em>, etc.).</p><p>The <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html#SL_9.1.2"><span id="essence">Essence</span> Imbedding</a> spell list and the <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html#SL_9.1.5"><span id="mentalism">Mentalism</span>/<span id="channeling">Channeling</span> Imbedding</a> spell list have had their names changed to Own Realm Imbedding and Other Realm Imbedding respectively. Values for daily items use the progressions from previous editions of <a href="5500.html"><em>Spell Law</em></a>. Thus, a <em>Daily V</em> spell can imbed a 1<sup>st</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> level spell (such that a 1<sup>st</sup> level spell could be cast 5 times a day, a 2<sup>nd</sup> level spell could be cast twice a day, or a 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, or 5<sup>th</sup> level spell could be cast once a day). The effects of <em>Constant</em> spells have been specifically defined.</p>
<p><a href="../en.lproj/spells.html#SL_9.1.3">Inorganic Skills</a> has been reworked along the lines of the <em>Alchemical Companion</em>. This, along with some modifications to the bonuses due to material composition, produces a scale in which items can have, at most, a +20 non-magical plus and all of the non-magical substances (including black alloy) can be enchanted. Working magical metals (e.g., mithril, laen, and eog) now requires that the corresponding <em>Enchant</em> spell be cast while the items are worked (so <em>Work Mithril</em> requires that a <em>Weapon V</em>, <em>Armor V</em>, or <em>General V</em> be cast along with the work spell). Once enchanted, these metals will have bonuses of +25, +30, and +35 respectively.</p>
<p>The <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#SL_9.1.4">Liquid/Gas Skills</a> spell list is essentially the same list that it was in previous editions of <a href="5522.html"><em>Spell Law</em></a>, though the specific effects of the poison spells have been defined. The <em>Gaseous Potion</em> spell from <em>Alchemy Companion</em> has also been added.</p>
<p>The <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#SL_9.1.6">Organic Skills</a> spell list is also broken up into a variety of lists. The <span id="essence">Essence</span> version of the list is taken from the version in the <em>Alchemy Companion</em>, which lowers the level of the Make spells when compared to previous editions of <a href="5522.html"><em>Spell Law</em></a>, but increases the level of many of the <em>Rune Paper</em> and <em>Wand</em> spells. The <span id="mentalism">Mentalism</span> an <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> arc similar in this respect, but, because they lack the <em>Rune Paper</em> spells, allow the Alchemists who possess them a much different range of abilities.</p>

<h1><a name="TC_2.0">2.0</a> TREASURE TYPES</h1>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/2.1/THE NATURE OF WEALTH" -->
<h2><a name="TC_2.1">2.1</a> THE NATURE OF WEALTH</h2>
<p>Wealth comes in a variety of forms. One important feature of the <em>Treasure Companion</em> is to help you understand these forms. After all, magical items are very expensive commodities and, like all commodities, someone must pay to have them created. There are two questions a GM should ask himself before he allows a particular item into his game: would anyone actually pay to create this item, and just how would they pay for it?</p>
<p>The first question can be very tricky to answer. Suppose that a particular Duke has 11,025 gold pieces to spend and is considering the following three options: (1) have a suit of +15, AT 19 armor constructed for himself; (2) spend 5000 gold on fixing the stonework on his north curtain wall and the rest on various tapestries that his wife wishes to brighten up the keep; (3) spend it keeping an army in the field. Assuming he has to spend 18 tp per day per person in his army (the cost of three light meals, though in actuality this is going to cover all sorts of costs and the army will be getting most of its food through forage), he could keep an army of 20,000 soldiers in the field for six months (6480 gold) and still get most of the work on his curtain wall done.</p>
<p>Of the three, while the armor is the best looking option to the average player character, it probably is of a lesser priority than the other two for the noble. A six month campaign against the right enemy could gain back many times the cost it would take to wage it. The curtain wall and amenity option not only may lead to greater security and domestic harmony, but could increase (he noble's social standing by directly showing off his wealth and status to any visitors he receives. While the armor is a wonderful personal protection, its utility to many non-adventurers is relatively low.</p>
<p>In very poor worlds, it may well be the case that mere economics would prohibit many items from being created. There is just not enough wealth. In these worlds, there may be few magical items. Even simple +10 magical weapons may be considered items of great renown and power simply because someone of power and infl uence actually bothered to have them made. GMs should remember that these sorts of worlds would have few of the superior non-magical items as well. While not as expensive, the above example still applies. The utility of a +15 non-magic suit of armor is relatively low compared to that of an army.</p>
<p>In these sorts of worlds GMs may have to justify item creation on a variety of different grounds rather than economics. One GM may simply say that the number and type of monsters is such that magical items would be greatly desired. If a particular GMs world is menaced by creatures, many of which have the Large critical type, magical items may be highly desirable for handling these menaces. Likewise, a world with many Undead or demons running around may be one where the need for magical weapons that can fight such beings would outweigh cost considerations. Even if such beings are not around now, they may have been a problem in the past, which might explain why adventurers can find such items out in the field and also why none of these items are actually being produced anymore.</p>
<p>Alternately, while these worlds may rule out much of the trade in magical armor and swords, this is not necessarily the case when it comes to daily and certain general items. After all, a noble may well decide that a cup which would constantly detect poison would be well worth postponing his campaign a year. Such an item would help him in his daily life and may outweigh the high monetary cost attached. General items that add to his leadership skills or his ability to trade with others may also more than pay for their cost and be considered wise investments of precious capital.</p>
<p>Another justification is that nobles, though one of the primary sources of funds for items, are also not the only ones. Adventurers themselves have plenty of reasons to shell out the money for a +15 magical sword; they do have tendencies to go places where armies cannot, and where the abilities of a few can mean all the difference. Even in poor worlds, nobles and merchants might be willing to pay to advance the careers of such adventurers, including financing item construction, in order to reap certain social rewards (a share of the fame the adventurers generate), favors, or a share of the moneys the party brings back. Though the cash value of this support would probably be very low for all but the most experienced parties, it might allow a party to keep stocked in low level items.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/2.1.1/WEALTH IN A CAMPAIGN" -->
<h3><a name="TC_2.1.1">2.1.1</a> WEALTH IN A CAMPAIGN</h3>
<p>The amount of wealth in a campaign will certainly help determine just what sorts of items get created. If, in the above example, the Duke could have spent 40,000 gold in a year instead of 11,025, then he could have taken all three options rather than just one. In such cases, nobles and others with wealth may take part of their fortune to invest in items that might, for them, have low utility, but look impressive. The amount a wealth in a campaign will be influenced by the following factors: basic wealth, banking, and stock companies.</p>
<h5><a name="TC_2.1.1.0.1">2.1.1.0.1</a> Basic Wealth</h5>
<p>Basic wealth is not just coins. In most campaigns, coins are actually going to be a very small amount of the basic wealth possessed by a society. Take, for example, an average nobleman. He may indeed have a strong box of coins in his keep. He might also has a fair amount of wealth in jewelry (from the gems in his wife's necklace to the simple bronze pins that hold his cloak closed in bad weather). He also probably possess a huge amount of money in nornlal everyday items. There arc the beds in his castle, the iron wall sconces, the flatware and pots in his kitchens, etc. There is also the weaponry in his armory, the boiling oil that protects his castle, and his siege weapons. Do not forget the castle itself, its auxiliary buildings, and perhaps a summer house on some other part of his estate. His estate may have a large number of chickens, pigs, goats, cattle, etc., all of which are part of basic wealth. In some societies, the value of a noble's slaves would also be added to this figure.</p><p>The value derived from land cannot be underestimated. Besides the value that could be generated from selling it were he so inclined, a noble generally receives yearly income from it. This income comes in the form of a share of all farming and animals raised on his land, in addition to a share taken from the profits of the sale of said items. Since he is likely to have many people living on his estates who will have certain needs that they cannot themselves satisfy, he is likely to attract skilled craftsman such as smiths, tailors, and skilled weavers to live in his domain. These people pay taxes on their property to the noble and often a sales tax of some sort as well. Further, if the noble's estate is lucky to have other sorts of resources such as timber and mines, those people who contract to take these resources also pay taxes. In some cases, the noble himself may own these companies which further increases his profit.</p>
<p><a href="5521.html"><em>Gamemaster Law</em></a> states that poor nobles should have wealth equal to about 10 times that of the player characters. If this wealth is basic wealth, it is probably very low. The average noble may well be worth many thousands of gold pieces, and indeed, in most kingdoms the tax collectors know to the iron piece just what the noblemen in their domain are worth. This is because nobles (and indeed most people) in medieval societies paid taxes based on the value of their property (i.e., basic wealth). Unlike modem property taxes, these taxes included the value of all the chickens, furniture, and other material possessions.</p>
<p>Locally, most of the taxes that a noble recei ves are not in the form of coin. Peasants often pay him in pigs, chickens, or farmed produce. This wealth has a nasty habit of going right into the bellies and onto the backs of his family, staff, and retainers. However, the taxes demanded by nobles further up the fealty chain are usually paid in the form of coins or gems (because it is often hard to transport more perishable items). When there is not enough coins and/or other transportable cash, the only other possibility is to turn over lands and estates to the person to whom the taxes arc due. This process is often avoided if at all possible, as it reduces the overall income of the noble in the future.</p>
<p>Consequently, many nobles try to hide their wealth from tax collectors and seek to acquire more portable sources of income. Though this can actually increase the amount of coins and other portable wealth in circulation, the nobleman is reluctant to spend this more portable wealth (as he sought to acquire it to pay taxes and probably would not spend it on anything else). In the end, the number of coins that many nobles have and arc willing to spend on magical items will be relatively small. It may be that in a game world where the players have several thousand gold pieces to spend, they have far more spcndable wealth than the average noble, though the total amount of basic wealth that the noble has far outstrips the wealth of the characters. Though the amount of spendable, portable wealth in a campaign may be small, this does not mean that expensi ve items cannot be produced. Indeed, though basic wealth is not necessarily portable, it does have the advantage that, barring disaster, it is very stable.</p>
<p>Alchemists (especially Guild Alchemists) may take payment from nobles (and others with large amounts of basic wealth) in forms other than cash. Nobles in areas secure from war may be able to allow the Alchemists to live on and/or use some of their land to payoff a debt. GMs should be careful to note that this is not deeding the land over to the Alchemist, just the right to use the land as a source of income to settle the noble's debt. Such agreements will usually be set up to go allow the Alchemist to occupy the land for a certain period of time (in which case the Alchemist bears the risk that he might not be able to get his money back within the time period) or until the amount of money owed is paid back (in which case the noble may not see his land back for some time).</p>
<p>The type of agreement depends on the relative bargaining strength of the parties. If the Alchemists have the upper hand, they will generally force the noble to agree to handing the land over until all of the debt is repaid. If the noble has the upper hand, he will generally force a fixed time contract which may well save him more money than if he actually had to pay the full cost of the item out of his own purse. Either way, some sort of joint overseer will probably be hired to make sure that neither side cheats the other and that the land is still worth its value when the tenant ship is over.</p>
<p>In addition, because of the stability of their basic wealth, nobles will often be extended far more generous terms of payment than adventurers will. Because the noble's land isn't going anywhere, and will be generating income over several years, Alchemists may take installment payments from a noble where they would not be willing to do so for an adventurer. If the noble fails to pay, there are probably others higher up in the kingdom's society that can force him to pay or extract the debtin other ways. Ifan adventurer reneges on a debt, or is killed, there may be little the Alchemist can do to recover the money owed.</p>
<p>In the end, while items can be created in a world where basic wealth is the primary source of wealth, there will be a variety of restrictions placed on whar can and will be created. GMs should think carefully before allowing an item that is very expensive into his campaign, or at least make it very hard to sell such items if the players acquire them.</p>
<h5><a name="TC_2.1.1.0.2">2.1.1.0.2</a> Banking</h5>
<p>Though the arguments about the effects of basic wealth were given with the example of nobles, they apply equally well to others in the society. Merchants, for example, may have a large amount of basic wealth in their wares (and may also have a large amount of coins), relatively little of that coinage is available for non-business purposes. Because they need to trade for items, often from far away places, they need all the portable wealth they can get. It is very difficult, after all, to transport a thousand chickens 10,000 miles to pay for a load of silk. Even rhe wealthiest of traders, who may have a large percentage of a kingdom's coinage and other portable wealth, will have little of it they can really spend on such luxuries as magical items.</p>
<p>Merchants often must rely on coins and bullion (or other transportable wealth) to make payments on their goods. They may have many coins in storage, but rarely will these be stored without a specific purpose in mind. Consequently, there will often be an imbalance between the merchants, who have large amount of portable wealth, and the nobles, who have even larger amounts of basic wealth that is not portable.</p>
<p>In many societies certain institutions will realize that these imbalances exist and take steps to correct them. In some the institutions will be sponsored by the merchants, in others the temples (which also tend to have a large amount of portable wealth from donations), and in still others certain cultural factions who are allowed the privilege of seeking a remedy to this problem. The mechanism that most societies develop to take care of these imbalances is known as banking.</p>
<p>The effects of banking on the overall amount of wealth in a kingdom are incredible. To begin with, banks can loan money. If a nobleman needs portable wealth to finance his next campaign, he can get a loan from a banker. This temporary arrangement can be secured by the value of the nobleman's land or by tenantship agreements (similar to those he might work out with Alchemists). Banks can also issue drafts (that can be easily carried), documents that tell other banks or individuals that a person has a certain amount of wealth. This allows someone to transfer their wealth quickly and without the costs of transporting the physical materials. If a bank is running low on physical funds, it can send to other banks to have them deliver the physical wealth.</p>
<p>Because banks charge interest, the money they loan generates more money. This money can in turn also be loaned to generate more money, etc. Societies with advanced banking generally become much richer than those that lack it. Admittedly, there are no guarantees with banks in most societies. A banker could go broke or embezzle all ofone's funds. Though banks may well have large amounts of money on their books, most societies will measure wealth in the value of physical objects. A run on the bank (the term for what happens when people try to withdraw more of their funds in physical currency then the bank has on hand to payout such requests) can be very dangerous to the local economy, not to mention the local banker. Because most bankers are personally responsible for the operations of their bank, one misstep could find them destitute, in prison, or even dead. Still, the rewards are incredible and many individuals find them well worth the risks.</p>
<p>Because capital is more plentiful in societies with banking, it tends to produce more types of businesses. Merchants and nobles can enter into certain types of partnerships for joint return. Companies can be formed, usually on a partnership basis, whose profits generate more wealth. Societies with banking will be much richer than those without it and consequently able to purchase more magical items. Such societies will also probably contain more magical items. After all, there is more wealth running around and more of it can be used for the production of said items. If banks exist in a particular GMs world he should consider making items more plentiful.</p>
<h5><a name="TC_2.1.1.0.3">2.1.1.0.3</a> Stock Companies</h5>
<p>Though not quite modern corporations, these entities existed in Renaissance times and perhaps even earlier. The idea behind a stock company is that a group of people will come together to pay for the cost of a venture or business. The investors in a stock company each put up a share of the money, to purchase a proportionate share of the company's stock. The company itself is considered to be an entity independent of its owners, with its own assets and debts. If the business succeeds, the owners get a share of the profits equal to their ownership in the company. If the venture does not work, they lose their money, but are not responsible (in most cases) for the debts of the company.</p>
<p>There are several differences between stock companies and modern corporations. The first is that the shares in a stock company are generally not publicly traded. One might privately sell one's share in a stock company, but generally there is not an open vehicle for sale of shares to the public. Another key difference is that stock companies are generally chartered institutions. They are put together for specific purposes with the express permission of the local government. Stock companies are often established to administer lands opened by trade, but which would be too expensive to manage directly. In some cases (e.g., England's East India Company), stock companies can function as the government of a particular area with authority coming directly from the ruling monarch.</p>
<p>The existence of stock companies will greatly increase the amount of wealth available in a given world. This is because they free their owners from the risks inherent in earlier forms of business. In a partnership, each party is responsible for the debts of a business if it goes down. They can be out their entire personal fortune if things go wrong. In a stock company, they lose the value of their shares but their personal property can generally not be threatened (though some angry monarchs may well ignore this if they are affected by a great loss). Consequently, people are much m.ore likely to take the risk of ownership in stock companIes than they are in partnerships. This has the effect of bringing more wealth out of banks and private hoards and Into the hands of companies, where it can be used to generate more wealth in the forms of goods and services.</p>
<p>Stock companies are also a vehicle of change for just what counts as real wealth in a society. Before their introducti?n into a society, real wealth will almost always equal basic wealth. Land was the ultimate yardstick for how wealthy a person was. Once stock companies develop wealth quickly passes from how much land one owns to how much income one's investment brings. Trade, not land, becomes the key to wealth.</p>
<p>With this in mind, it is quite possible that societies that have stock companies, beyond just being able to pay for more magical items, have greater need for such items. Trade depends on exploration and explored routes being kept clear. Stock companies may well find that it is worth the price to pay an Alchemist to create a variety of items that would. help them go about their business. These may vary from Items that control the winds to ones that add to piloting rolls, magical siege engines that can help defend a ship and its cargo, etc. Stock companies may also be able to fund parties of adventurers, supplying them with items (usually relatively inexpensive ones) in order to get them to explore new lands and open trade routes. A successful party might even be brought into the company to act as trouble-shooters or overseers of various possessions.</p>

<h3><a name="TC_2.1.2">2.1.2</a> SOME ADDITIONAL CONSEDARATIONS</h3>
<p>As you can see, the amount of wealth in the world will be greatly influenced by what sorts of institutions exist in the world. GMs should consider this carefully when determinIng Just what sorts of items exist in his world and how these items were paid for in the first place. Also, because the players will generally have much less wealth than other forces in the society, it may be very hard for the players to get the ear of a local Alchemist. Maybe the players can afford their +10 sword, but do they have the political connections of the Duke of Logan? Because there are assumed to be relatively few Alchemists, those who exist will be in great demand and are likely to give their business to those who could be regular clients rather than just anyone off the street. Players may have to wait months to get an item made and will probably have to pay at least half down.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/2.2.1/COINS" -->
<h3><a name="TC_2.2.1">2.2.1</a> COINS</h3>
<p>Metals have long been desired by beings for their malleability, beauty, resistance to the effects of time, and rarity. The value of a metal is based upon these factors among others. Coinage made of metal has its value dervied from price of the metal's weight. This value may vary depending on the purity of the metal. Certain kingdoms' coinage may be worth more than others depending on how pure their coins are.</p>
<h5><a name="TC_2.2.1.0.1">2.2.1.0.1</a> Value of Coins</h5>
<p>Making coins is a relatively simple process. After the ore is refined, it is molded or pressed and then stamped into coins. The dies used to stamp out the coins are usually carved with the symbol of the kingdom, the face of the current king, etc., so that they can be easily identified. The ability to identify the age and nationality of a coin can be very important, because different countries often use different levels of purity in their coins. Because minting practices are, in theory, standardized within a country, one can often tell the metal content of a coin just by looking at where it came from. This is not fool proof for several reasons, one of which is that at different times kingdoms may use different standards for the purity of their coins. By knowing the age and the nationality of a coin, one's chances of assessing its value are much higher.</p>
<p>Because the weight of pure metal is the important factor in assessing the value of a coin, several practices tend to arise in regards to coinage. The first, as discussed above, is that most kingdoms will go to great lengths to make sure that their coins meet certain purity standards. These standards are generally known to the populous. The theory is that if the populous trusts the value of a nation's coins, there will be more desire for these coins and more trade will use them and less of the coinage of rival countries. After all, if the populous believes in a certain coinage, they can take less time making transactions. Also, because they know that the metal has a specific purity level, the weight uniform, etc., the citizens' demand for a particular coinage can actually raise the price of that coinage to greater than that of its metal value. Thus, a country's coinage could actually be worth more (through demand) than the cost of the metals that were used to produce it. This can lead to a tidy profit for the country's government. This theory, however, rarely works out in practice.</p><h5><a name="TC_2.2.1.0.2">2.2.1.0.2</a> Coin Shaving</h5>
<p>First of all, there is the practice of shaving coins. Coins of good reputation can have tiny amounts of metal shaved off of them. There might not be much loss in terms of any individual coin, but several hundred shaved coins can add up to a large amount ofmetal. This metal can then be melted down and sold to metal smiths or made into counterfeit coins. Because coins (in medieval or even Renaissance times) are rarely perfectly regular in shape, there is generally little notice taken of the slight irregularities shaving might have caused, though if the coin is weighed, the reduction in value can be discovered. To prevent shaving, many countries will have grooves stamped into the sides of their coins, though an enterprising shaver can carve out replicas of these grooves in the softer metals. In most kingdoms, the punishment for shaving is death. This is how seriously many kingdoms take the value of their coinage.</p>
<h5><a name="TC_2.2.1.0.3">2.2.1.0.3</a> Debasing Coins</h5>
<p>However, coin shaving was rarely massively impacting on the enconomy of a nation. Governments often do far more to decrease the value of their coinage than shavers did. Many kingdoms, when strapped to pay their debts, instruct their mints to change the purity content of their coins. This is generally done in secret, and allows the government to stretch the amount of pure metal over a larger number ofcoins to payoffits obligations. Ofcourse, such actions are rarely kept secret for long. Eventually, this trick is discovered. Because most debts are structured for repayment in a certain amount of coin, rather than by the weight of a certain amount of pure metal, there is little those affected by the scam can do. However, it hurts the reputation of the coins and in the long run leads to inflation. Once the coinage had been debased in this manner, the new standard is eventually made known. Very rarely does the old standard ever get reinstated. Some kingdoms might become quite enamored with this process (regularly debasing their own coinage) and eventually end up in financial ruin.</p>
<p>To protect themselves from these techniques, the habit of weighing coins came about. Because weighing relied on the generally accepted standard for the purity of a particular coin, it quickly let both parties know if they were dealing with a shaved or debased coin. If the coins had a different weight than the purity standards indicated, something was wrong. Of course, scales could be rigged too, so it was often a chore to figure outjust how many coins were necessary for a transaction.</p>
<h5><a name="TC_2.2.1.0.4">2.2.1.0.4</a> Cutting Coins</h5>
<p>Coins were also often cut into smaller pieces to aid in specific transactions. It was often easier to just cut the coin in half than to make change, especially for gold coins. Many merchants did not have enough coins on hand to actually change a gold piece, so they would cut the coin in two, four, or even eight pieces and select a piece of the appropriate weight for the transaction. Because value was based on the weight of the coin's pure metal content, noone was harmed by this sort of transaction, though it increased the possibility of coin shaving since the shaver now had access to the cut sides of the coin rather than just the circumference.</p>
<h5><a name="TC_2.2.1.0.5">2.2.1.0.5</a> Coins in the Game</h5>
<p>In Rolemaster, coins are very idealized. They are assumed to be made of almost pure metal, uniform in consistency, and one quarter ounce each. The value of each type ofcoin is ten times greater than the next lesser type (ten iron pieces to the tin piece, ten tin to the copper, etc.). This produces a simple system that is easy to keep track of and allows for easy determination of the weight of objects made from these metals. GMs who feel that they want more variety in their coinage systems should feel free to set up different weights, purity standards, and relations between the value of the various metals. Though this may add considerable work when making transactions or determining the cost of items, it can add a great deal of detail to the atmosphere of their worlds.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/2.2.2/THE METALS" -->
<h3><a name="TC_2.2.2">2.2.2</a> THE METALS</h3>
<p>Though iron, tin, and copper are really base (lesser) metals they are included in this section, because <strong><em>Rolemaster</em></strong> assumes that they are used in many kingdoms to produce coins. Silver, gold, platinum, and aluminum (where it was known) were considered precious metals in the Middle Ages.</p>
<h5><a name="TC_2.2.2.0.1">2.2.2.0.1</a> Iron</h5>
<p>Iron is a common clement that is valued because of its ease of shaping and the durability of items created with it. If alloyed with carbon, it creates steel, which can be hardened to hold a variety of edges and have varying degrees oftoughness. Iron can also be welded, unlike some other elements, so repairs on iron tools and implements are often easier than other metals. Iron's primary drawback is that it is susceptible to oxidation.</p>
<h5><a name="TC_2.2.2.0.2">2.2.2.0.2</a> Tin</h5>
<p>Tin, like iron, is an easy to shape metal. However, it resists corrosion better than iron. Though somewhat soft and not generally used in its raw form, tin is valued because it is an important component in many alloys.</p>
<h5><a name="TC_2.2.2.0.3">2.2.2.0.3</a> Copper</h5>
<p>Copper is a soft metal that was one of the first substances men learned to refine from raw are. It is soft and very malleable, and is often shaped into a variety of bowls, drinking vessels, and other items that are not required to hold an edge. Copper weapons and cutting tools were used in some societies, but they tended to be too soft to remain sharp, and because they must be recast if they break, were very time consuming to actually repair. Copper also corrodes over time.</p>
<h5><a name="TC_2.2.2.0.4">2.2.2.0.4</a> Bronze</h5>
<p>Bronze is an alloy of one part tin to nine parts copper, though it sometimes contains other elements such as lead or zinc. It can be cast into a variety of shapes, and it will corrode over time. It is harder than copper, and holds an edge longer, making it far more suitable for armor and weapons. Depending on the exact alloy, it can be as hard as many high carbon steels, though it is just as brittle (see Section @#$). Unlike steel and iron, it cannot be welded, so it tends to be harder to repair a bronze weapon than a steel/iron one. Broken bronze weapons must be melted down and recast. This process is much more expensive and time consuming than welding, so in most cultures that have access to steel, bronze is not used for cutting implements</p>
<h5><a name="TC_2.2.2.0.5">2.2.2.0.5</a> Silver</h5>
<p>Silver is a beautiful metal that casts well and can be made into a variety ofshapes. In some areas, it was more valuable than gold due to its rarity. It is sometimes alloyed with gold and other metals to produce coinages of intermediate values. Silver does tarnish and turns black with age, though it is possible to clean and polish it. However, most medieval cleaning methods would slowly strip off the corroded silver, so the value of silver items could be eaten away if people were not careful.</p>
<h5><a name="TC_2.2.2.0.6">2.2.2.0.6</a> Gold</h5>
<p>One of the most valuable of metals, gold is prized for its beauty, malleability, and the fact that it does not corrode. Items made of gold will not tarnish or stain and retain their beauty for all time unless damaged. Gold is extremely soft, so it is often alloyed with other metals to give it strength. Such alloys are generally considered to be gold and are rated on a karat system (not to be confused with the carat, a unit of gem weight). Eaeh karat represents one part of pure gold. A measure of 24 karats is considered to be pure gold.</p>
<h5><a name="TC_2.2.2.0.7">2.2.2.0.7</a> Platinum</h5>
<p>Platinum is a very hard silvery metal that is very corrosion resistant. Though very rare in most regions there have been some countries that used platinum as a type of coin, especially if gold was not available. Some countries even went so far as to prevent the export of their platinum coinage, fearing that other countries would realize they possessed little gold and think less of them.</p>
<h5><a name="TC_2.2.2.0.8">2.2.2.0.8</a> Aluminum</h5>
<p>Though not used as a coin in most countries before modern times, aluminum was one of the most valuable metals for most of Earth's history. Aluminum is one of the most common elements. It is the building block of many gems, and the mineral bauxite. Indeed, it is found as an element of so many minerals that pure aluminum was almost unknown and prized by kings and kingdoms when it was found.</p><h5><a name="TC_2.2.2.0.9">2.2.2.0.9</a> Mithril</h5>
<p>Mithril ore (with no historical equivalent) is usually more common than pure aluminum; indeed, it is found in about the same quantities as platinum. What makes this element so valuable is that it can only be processed by magical spells (see <a href="#TC_13.1.1">Section 13.1.1, Alchemist Base spell lists</a>), and then only the greatest of Alchemists can actually cast such spells. These coins are usually one-of-a-kind works of art and often possess magical abilities. They are usually worth many times their actual coinage value.</p>

<h2><a name="TC_2.3">2.3</a> GEMS</h2>
<p>Gems have been valued for thousands of years for their beauty, rarity, and supposed magical abilities. Amethysts were thought to protect the wearer from intoxication and poison. Diamonds were seen as a remedy for all sicknesses. The beautiful green color of emeralds were not normally seen in other stones. For these reasons, and a multitude of others, individuals have fought and died to transport, sell, and mine these precious commodities.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/2.3.1/PROPERTIES" -->
<h3><a name="TC_2.3.1">2.3.1</a> PROPERTIES</h3>
<p>Gems are described by a variety of properties. These properties come from two areas. The first is the chemical composition of the gem. Most gemstones are minerals that have formed into crystals. The nature of these crystalline formations determines the transparency (how much light the gemstone will transmit), luster (the appearance of light from a polished stone), specific gravity (a measure of density), and hardness. There are many other properties determined by chemical composition, but these are the main ones that let jewelers tell one type of stone from the next.</p>
<p>The second factor that detennines properties in gemstones is the admixtures that occur within the stones. Admixtures are other minerals that occur in trace amounts and give color to many gems. If we look at a type of gemstonc, such as corundum, we find that it is made of aluminum oxide. This chemical composition provides it with its hardness, its transparency, its specific gravity, and other factors. If the specific corundum has admixtures of chromium, it will have a beautiful red color, though the shade will vary depending on the amount of chromium, and the jeweler will call it a ruby. Ifit has admixtures ofbivalent iron with traces of titanium, then it is called a sapphire instead.</p>
<h5><a name="TC_2.3.1.0.1">2.3.1.0.1</a> Transparency</h5>
<p>Transparency is the amount of light transmitted through a substance. Transparency is effected not just by the chemical structure of the stone, but by its thickness color, and the presence of flaws in the gemstone. A stone is considered to be <em>transparent</em> if light will pass through it as if it were glass. <em>Semitransparent</em> stones will allow the outline of an object to be seen through them. <em>Translucent</em> stones allow some light to pass through but one cannot see an object, or its outline, through them. <em>Non-transparent</em> or <em>opaque</em> stones do not allow light to pass through them even in small sections. If a stone is both transparent and colorless it is often called <em>lucid</em>.</p>
<h5><a name="TC_2.3.1.0.2">2.3.1.0.2</a> Luster</h5>
<p>Luster is the property of reflecting light from a gem's surface. The smoother the surface of a stone, the higher a degree of luster the stone will show. This explains why stones that are harder (which can take a greater degree of polishing) are often more luminous than stones that are not as hard.</p>
<p>Stones with the highest degree of luster are called <em>adamantine</em> (diamond-like). Some opaque gem stones such as pyrite and hematite have a <em>metallic</em> luster because they reflect light much like gold and silver do. Most gem stones have a <em>vitreous</em> (glass-like) luster. Vitreous luster covers a large range of appearances and many gemstones (such as topaz) that are in this category are far more lustrous than others (such as quartz).</p>
<p>The weaker types of luster are resinous, <em>greasy</em>, and waxy. Certain fibrous minerals, such as cats eye, have a <em>silky</em> luster, while others display a pearly luster. If a gem has little or no luster it is considered to be dull.</p>
<h5><a name="TC_2.3.1.0.3">2.3.1.0.3</a> Hardness</h5>
<p>The chemical structure of a gemstone gives it a specific hardness or durability. This property is one of the most important ones for identifying the gem and is important for determining its value (see below). At one time, the border line between semi-precious and precious gems (see below) was drawn by hardness alone.</p>
<p>Hardness is rated on a scale from one to 10 with diamond having the highest rating (at a 10) and talc having the lowest rating (at a 1). Gems that are higher on the scale will scratch those that are lower on the scale. On Earth this scale was invented by the German mineralogist Friedrich Mohs (1773-1839) and bears his name; the Mohs' Hardness Scale. GMs should feel free to change the name or simply refer to it as "the hardness scale" if they do not want to use Mohs' name in their world.</p>
<h5><a name="TC_2.3.1.0.4">2.3.1.0.4</a> Specific Gravity</h5>
<p>Specific gravity is its weight compared to the weight of an identical volume of water at a temperature of 4&deg; Celsius. Specific gravity is related, but not quite the same, as the density of an item and is an important means of telling one gem type from another. Specific gravity is expressed in a ration of its weight per volume compared to the weight per volume of water. So a gem, such as an opal, with a specific gravity of 2.05 has a weight per volume that is 2.05 times greater than that of water.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/2.3.2/VALUE" -->
<h3><a name="TC_2.3.2">2.3.2</a> VALUE</h3>
<p>The value of gemstones is based on a variety of factors. It is hard to say what is the greatest factor for the value a gemstone. However, beauty may be a strong candidate. Gemstones, whether a transparent diamond or an opaque jet, add color and richness to the lives of those who own them. In societies (and times) where owning colors other than brown or dun was seen as a sign of wealth, owning something as pretty as a sapphire certainly made the individual stand out.</p>
<p>The second component to the value of a gemstone is certainly rarity. Emeralds, for example, are very scarce and this (combined with their beauty) leads to a great demand for these stones. Chrysolite, also called peridot or olivine, though it often resembles emeralds, is much more common, and for that reason and others it is much less expensive.</p>
<p>A third factor of value is quality. Many gemstones will come in a variety of grades which will range in luster, transparency, and color. Sometimes gems that are very common as mineral deposits will produce crystals large enough and with enough quality to be rated as gemstones, even though in more common forms they have no particular value. Certain combinations of the same stone (though  usually with different admixtures) will be more: valuable than others, such as the transparent red, lustrous fire opal, which is much more valuable than its rather dull white and translucent cousin, hydrophane (or world's eye opal).</p>
<p>A fourth factor that is often of great importance is the hardness of a stone. Harder stones are generally more valuable than softer stones. Chrysolite, for example, is a beautiful green stone that is often mistaken for emerald. Though it is a beautiful transparent stone that is very rare in some areas, it is not nearly as valuable as emeralds because it is very soft and is easily chipped and abraded. Consequently, chrysolite jewelry and gemstones do not retain their value as well as similar jewelry containing emeralds. This pushes the demand for the stones down, and thus the price goes down as well.</p><p>These four factors, and others (including society's current fads and fashions), drive the price of gemstones. GMs should feel free to modify the prices given in Table @#$ (in Part III) if they think a particular stone would be rarer or more valued in their particular world.</p>
<p>Players and GMs should also realize that gems are commodities to be bought and sold. They are not a form of cash. Most businesses are not set up to trade in gems, and may not be willing to take them at other than a considerable loss to the characters (-50 to all <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Trading">Trading</a> maneuvers unless you are dealing with a jeweler or a money changer). Jewelers (who pass the cost of gems on to their customers) and money changers may well be willing to trade characters cash for their gems (though they normally charge a fee of 1% to 5% of a gem's value).</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/2.3.3/CUTS" -->
<h3><a name="TC_2.3.3">2.3.3</a> CUTS</h3>
<p>A lapidary is someone who cuts gems. Rough gems are often large and contain cracks or foreign matter called flaws. To remove this material and produce a more beautiful and valuable gem, lapidaries remove ("cut") material from raw gems.</p>
<p>Originally, the most common way of doing this was by a process known as tumbling. Raw gemstones would be placed in a barrel or drum with water. The barrel would then be turned round and round. After several days, the stones would be rinsed and the drum filled with polishing compound. The drum would then be rotated until the stones were polished. Even such valuable stones as diamonds and sapphires were treated in this manner as late as the thIrteen or fourteen hundreds on Earth.</p>
<p>Almost as old as tumbling stones is the art of glyptography (gem engraving). Polished or unpolished soft gems were engraved with pictures in prehistoric times. By the classical period, harder stones such as agate and jasper had elaborate cameos (portraits) engraved in them. Carved diamonds first appeared in the 1600s on Earth. One of the more common uses for these carved gems was for sealing rings.</p>
<p>Cut gems were a much later development. Cut gems are achieved by having material removed, usually by precise blows, along fracture lines to produce planes called facets. These facets are usually symmetrical around the stone. One of the earliest types of cuts was the Rose Cut which has a pyramidal faceted crown (top) and a flat base. Emerald Cuts and Table Cuts, with roughly rectangular crowns, were known in classical times. The modern standard, the Brilliant Cut (most commonly used for diamonds), was developed in 1660 in France on Earth.</p>
<p>GMs may wish to take the appearance of gems into account in their world. Perhaps most of the gems are simple tumbled or are Table Cut gems, but a few are cut by the lapidaries of a particular race who make more beautiful gemstones. Such stones might be worth many times their more common counterparts. GMs may wish to assign a modifier such as x5 or x10 to the value of stones with more modern facet cuts than those that lack them.</p>

<h2><a name="TC_2.4">2.4</a> GEM GRADES</h2>
<p>In various time periods different methods for rating the value of gems have been used. One of the most common is a distinction between precious, semi-precious, and ornamental stones. In such a system gems would be classified into these categories on the basis of value. In theory, just knowing what grade of gem would give one a good idea of how much the stone was worth.</p>
<p>Such systems, however, have little real use since prices are determined by the characteristics of individual gem stones, not by reference to some arbitrary category. Value among the same gem type can vary enormously depending on the specific weight, quality, rarity, color, and luster of a particular gem (not to mention such factors as fashion). In modern times, though the terms still exist, they are not normally used to determine value. Instead, gems are sold on an individual basis based on their own charactenstics.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this supplement, however, the <em>Treasure Companion</em> does divide gems into precious and semi-precious stone. This was done to help delineate the treasure charts (see <a href="#TC_14.0">Section 14</a>) and organize the stones for presentation. GM's should feel free to divide the gems up differently if they so choose. If a GM wants to refer to any gem worth less than one bronze piece as an ornamental stone (or by any other name), he should do so.</p>
<p>In the Treasure Companion precious gems are considered stones with a value of one silver piece or more per carat, whik semi-precious stones have a value ofless than a silver piece per carat. If a GM feels that a particular kind of stone should be considered either a precious or a semI-precious stone in his world, he will need to adjust the price accordingly. The price per carat of each gem vanety may be found in <a href="#TC_14.0">Section 14.0</a>.</p>

<p>Alchemy has been many things to many people. Historically, alchemy was a way of seeking enlightenment. Practitioners viewed its many experiments as guides to improving the self and reaching a greater understanding of the world around them. In mythology, creator gods such as Vulcan assembled works of power and sophistication of which men could only dream. In the works of fiction writers, it has been everything from the life works of a few elite individuals, to the experiments of crackpot inventors. In fantasy role playing, it is one of the most interesting and easily abused elements a GM can add to his game.</p>

<h2><a name="TC_3.1">3.1</a> HISTORICAL ALCHEMY</h2>
<blockquote><p>"The extraction of the soul out ofgold orsilver, by what vulgar way ofalchymy soever, is but mere fancy. "</p>
<p id="right">&mdash;Alexander Seton, one of the most "successful" Renaissance alchemists (and a charlatan), circa AD 1600.</p></blockquote>
<p>With minor cultural variations, alchemy and its principles developed in many societies all over the world. Strong alchemical traditions occur in diverse regions such as ancient China, Australia, India, Arabia, Egypt, Greece, Celtic Europe, and Central and South America. However, it seems likely that alchemy originated among the skilled metallurgists of the Middle East, possibly Mesopotamia. From there the practice spread east and west along caravan routes. Alchemy also influenced major religions such as Christianity, Daoism, Islam, and others.</p>
<p>Also known as "Ars Magna" or the royal art, the study of alchemy was first codified (written down) in Alexandria, Egypt. The heart of alchemical theory is attributed to the Emerald Tablet of Hermes Trismegistus. This tablet was discovered in an Egyptian cave clutched in Hermes' mummified hands by Alexander the Great. The quote below is the entirety of the Emerald Tablet, translated into English.</p>
<h5><a name="TC_3.1.0.0.1">3.1.0.0.1</a> Alchemy, the Operation of the Sun</h5>
<blockquote><p>"It is true without lie, certain and most veritable, that what is below is like what is above and that what is above is like what is below, to perpetrate the miracles ofone thing.</p>
<p>"And as all things have been, and comefrom One by the meditation of One; thus all things have been born from this single thing by adaptation.</p>
<p>"The Sun is its father and the Moon its mother.</p>
<p>"The Wind has carried it in his belly and the Earth is its nurse. The father of all the perfection [Telesmus] of all the world is here.</p>
<p>"Its force or power is entire if it is turned into earth.</p>
<p>"Thou shalt separate the Earthfrom the Fire, the subtle from the gross, softly, with great ingenuity.</p>
<p>"It rises from the Earth to the sky and again descends into Earth, and receives the force of things superior and inferior. "Thou shalt have by this means the glory ofall the world. And therefore all obscurity shall flee from thee.</p>
<p>"From this shall be and shall proceed admirable adaptations, of which the means is here.</p>
<p>"And in this connection I am called Hermes Trismegistus, having the three parts of the philosophy of all the world.</p>
<p>"It is finished, what I have said of the operation of the Sun."</p>
<p id="right">&mdash; Hermes Trismegistus, circa 1000 BC, Tabula Smaragdina (The Emerald Tablet).</p></blockquote><p>Initially, this bizarre text may seem incomprehensible, but to Alchemists this work has great significance. It contains both the doctrines of cosmic unity and the inner relation of all parts. Alexander took this knowledge to Greece, where it was translated from the Phoenician Hieroglyphics into Greek. These writings were formalized and expanded by a series of authors known as the Hermetics. Their study came to be known as the Hermetic Philosophy.</p>
<p>At this stage, alchemy consisted of a combination of magical lore, Greek natural philosophy, and practical knowledge of metal working. Much later, heretical Christians known as Gnostics injected early Christian doctrine into this body of work, keeping the practice alive during the Dark Ages.</p>
<p> The study of alchemy experienced a resurgence of interest in Western Europe during the 1200s. Stimulated by Arabic influences, the practice reached full flower during the 15th and 16th centuries. Although some alchemists were burned at the stake, most held the open patronage of kings, archbishops, and even popes. Several types of historical alchemists have been documented. Scholarly alchemists or "adepts" were interested in the philosophical insights to be gained from alchemy. Adepts claimed to know great secrets; the innermost mysteries of alchemy. "Puffers" restricted their interests to practical problems of metalworking, including transmuting metals. They gained their name from pumping the bellows for their furnaces. A "charlatan's" only ambition was to separate fools from their money through trickery and deception. A favored ploy involved hoodwinking others into believing they had transmuted lead into gold.</p>
<p>Alchemy contains both practical and spiritual aspects, as well as religious overtones. The philosophy of alchemy states that the cosmos is harmonious, unified and pervaded by a universal spirit. In practice, alchemists attempted to concentrate and purify matter into a substance containing this universal spirit-also known as the Philosopher's Stone. Only the most spiritually pure person could be a successful alchemist. In other words, in order to make gold, one must be pure enough not to want gold! Another tenet of alchemy proclaims that all forms of matter are really one, having the same origin. Individual forms of matter occur through evolutionary processes, leading alchemists to believe all metals are alive. For example, lead desires to better itself by becoming the purest of all metals, gold. Mirroring this process, the ultimate goal of alchemists is to transform their souls into more pure and lofty states.</p>
<p>On the practical level, alchemists concern themselves with powers of transmutation, curing diseases, prolonging life indefinitely, and other miracles. Furthermore, by tapping the universal spirit, alchemists can create an artificial man or "homunculus." A major objective of most alchemists is creating the Philosopher's Stone; a substance which occurs both in solid (Tincture) or liquid (Elixir) form. This "stone" can transmute lead into gold, sickness into health, old age into youthfulness, and sinful man into a spiritually pure man. Alchemy is based not so much on principles of chemistry but on rituals of purification and distillation of elements. For example, water distilled 5,000 or more times under certain conditions might yield the Philosopher's Elixir.</p>
<p>Alchemy remains couched in obscure terminology. This obfuscation is deliberate in order to mislead outsiders about the nature of alchemy. For example, the statement "Sol is eaten by the Green Dragon" means that gold dissolves in Aqua Regia. Because of this obscurity, fakers abound. Anagrams, enigmas, ciphers, numerology and acrostics disguise alchemists' ideas. For example, the Philosopher's Stone is denoted by the word Azoth, formed by the initial letter (A) followed by the last letter (Z) from the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew alphabets. This signifies that the Philosopher's Stone is the beginning and the end of all things. To disguise their experiments, alchemists also resort to allegories and mythological fables to describe the procedures.</p>
<p>A frustrating practice, the study of alchemy presents innumerable obstacles on the path to the Philosopher's Stone. Distractions are many; often crucibles crack or fluids evaporate at critical moments, ruining the experiment. This is not the only danger. Greedy and impatient patrons do not hesitate to employ threats or torture as forms of encouragement. Furthermore, if townspeople suspect that an alchemist has discovered the Philosopher's Stone, they might mob him for doses of the Elixir. Historically, a few alchemists actually lost their lives to mob frenzy.</p>
<p>Often, great alchemists wrote books of magic called "Grimoires," containing recipes and rituals of the trade. Usually these books were attributed to mythical figures from the past. For example, the Lesser Key of Solomon, penned in the 13th century was supposedly written by the biblical Solomon. It contains white magic, which may be safely used only if the proper purification rituals are observed. This grimoire consists of long, complex, and elaborate rituals geared towards producing a nearly impossible state of spiritual purity. These rituals are heavily influenced by astrology and center primarily on conjuring demonic servants. The ritual purification was necessary to protect the soul from demonic influence. All alchemists tried to acquire such texts for their own personal libraries. Grimoires of the past keep alive today the knowledge and experience of medieval alchemy.</p>

<h2><a name="TC_3.2">3.2</a> FANTASY ALCHEMY</h2>
<p>Unlike historical Alchemy, Alchemy in fantasy fiction and role playing tends to be concerned solely with the production of magical items. Whether swords created by the gods or other divine or demonic beings, potions created from witches' cauldrons, the mad experiments of a crazed inventor, or the arcane creations of a society dedicated to the study of magic, all such activities can be lumped under the heading of Alchemy. Though there are major differences, each is concerned with the creation of something new and powerful that otherwise would not have existed.</p>
<p>If magical items are going to exist in a fantasy role playing game, the GM has some decisions to make. Just what sort of Alchemy is it to be that creates these items? Are the gods the only source of such wonders, or can mortals create them? If mortals can create them, just who are these people and what is the nature of the knowledge that allows them to make these items? Answering these questions can be quite a chore, though studying how Alchemy is generally portrayed in fantasy can be very helpful. It is important to note that a GM can come to more than one conclusion on these subjects. Nothing says that there might not be many types of Alchemists in a particular fantasy world.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/3.2.1/GREATER ALCHEMY" -->
<h3><a name="TC_3.2.1">3.2.1</a> GREATER ALCHEMY</h3>
<p>Greater Alchemy is both the alchemy used and practiced by the gods and other such supernatural beings, and the Alchemy that may have been possible in previous ages, but is not possible at the time of the campaign. In other words, it represents items that can be acquired by the players, but which cannot be produced by them or their contemporaries. Such items as the Simirils, the sword Excalibur, and the Holy Grail are examples of this sort of Alchemy.</p>
<p>Greater Alchemy is generally surrounded by mystery. It is not the sort of thing that existing races are capable of, and, as such, the items it creates may be feared or heralded as items of worship. Such items are probably very rare, and may be of extreme power. They quite often possess a ruthless (though not necessarily evil) intelligence. Also, such items generally have specific purposes intended by their creators. They are not just better in combat, or even add a slaying critical to certain beings, but instead they are struggling for some grand and broad goal (e.g., the downfall of some race or kind of creature). They do not just stop a little bleeding, but heal the deathly sick and restore the limbs of the aged. They do not simply glow, but shine with the purpose for which they were created. In short, even if they are not incredibly powerful, they are awe inspiring. No work that a mortal race is now capable of can do whatthese devices do.</p>
<p>In campaigns where these sort of items exist, they are probably much sought after. Churches will wish to protect the items of their gods, while the followers of rival deities will seek to destroy them. Certain races may go to great lengths to gather and maintain control over the items of their ancestors. Powerful wizards may seek to hoard them to gain their power or hide them from others. They are the focus of powerful forces which seek to control, destroy, or aide in the purposes for which they were created.</p>
<p>When such items find their way into the hands of adventurers, they are generally not permanent possessions. These items have a purpose. They cannot be owned as much as traveled with. When their purpose has been fulfilled, or when they find someone else who is better able to fulfill their needs, they pass from the keeping of the adventurers into the hands of others. Perhaps they return to the church from whence they came, simply disappear from the face of the world, or are passed on by a dying guardian to the next keeper.</p>
<p>Though these items may solve a great problem, those that use such items tend to pay a heavy price. These items move nations, cause great beasts to be slain, and press evil (or good) back. What are the lives of a few mortals, compared to the needs for which the item was created? To the item, probably nothing.</p>
<p>If a GM chooses to use these sorts of items, be prepared to make them the focus of the campaign at least while the characters are seeking to possess them. They are just too big to be anything less. Players may have to quest for years to find them, convince their guardians (through reason or force) to let them have access to the item, and then face the daunting experience of actually wielding such power. These items are generally made to defeat enemies of great power, so make sure that there are enemies of great power to be faced. Whether it is a foreign army or an ancient demon, if the challenges do not match up to the power of the item, the game will probably fall flat on its face. Even with these items, the challenges must be great or everyone will feel the hollow victory.</p>
<p>Likewise, a GM needs to take great care not to neglect the players when he interjects these items into his campaign. It is far too easy to take an otherwise enjoyable campaign and tum it into six guys following around the great magic sword. These items are only used in extraordinary circumstances and should only be used by extraordinary individuals. One approach that works, is to tell the players as little as possible about how the item works or what exactly its powers are. This way, they will be forced to rely on themselves and their abilities, at least to get the item to the appropriate place for its powers to come into beings. Another idea is to have the prophecies, advice, or whatever leads the players to the item speak about those people who shall wield it in glowing terms. Make sure they know that they are the heroes who are using the item to perform a task only they can do, rather than an escort service that any group of peasants could perform.</p>
<p>Rules for Greater Alchemy are not specifically given here in <em>Alchemy Companion</em>. However, the items found in the <a href="#TC_16.6">Section 16.6</a> can be very helpful. The best idea is for a GM to find or create an item that has the sort of effects needed to complete a particular quest. Interject it into the campaign and let the players go about completing the quest you set up for them. If a GM wishes to create this sort of item, he can use the rules for item creation (<a href="#TC_9.0">Section 9.0</a>) and Divine Alchemy as a guide, but should not feel constrained to do so. As long as the item looks and feels important, then exact creation stats are not necessary.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/3.2.2/EXPERIMENTAL ALCHEMY" -->
<h3><a name="TC_3.2.2">3.2.2</a> EXPERIMENTAL ALCHEMY</h3>
<p>This version of alchemy deals with worlds where alchemy is either very new or very dangerous. Alchemists are seen as a mad breed, often shunned by (and shunning) society because of the dangers that item creation represents. Old men creating golems in windmills, mad experimenters who channel the forces of nature through precarious apparatus, and evil beings who sell souls to demons in return for bits of knowledge can all be seen as part of this view of alchemy.</p>
<p>Unlike Greater Alchemy, Experimental Alchemy puts magic item creation squarely in the hands of mortals; unfortunately, mortals who do not (or cannot) handle it very well. There could be a variety of reasons for this, but all reasons will center around the lack of knowledge of the subject of alchemy. Even the best practitioner is still just a child who is playing with things he should not be.</p>
<p>With this type of Alchemy, items are not the sort of things that drive armies or nations to battle. Frankly, most people (even knowledgeable ones) probably fear possessing such items. They were created by potentially dangerous people and might well blow up if used incorrectly. Those that do usc these items arc probably seen as being a little mad themselves or perhaps power-hungry enough to run the risks.</p>
<p>Experimental Alchemy is practiced by folk who fiercely desire to understand and control the world. Their fanaticism leads them to scorn their fellow beings, half starve themselves, and take great risks to gain the privacy and rare ingredients that make their art possible. To accomplish this, they will probably be very interested in making items for adventurers. After all, how else are many of these individuals going to pay for their experiments? They will need to send people out to gather their ingredients, kidnap individuals to be sacrificed, or just to get them food from time to time.</p>
<p>Under Greater Alchemy, gods and demons themselves might be responsible for the creation of items. Experimental Alchemists, if they deal with such beings, use various spells to contact and gain the power necessary for their experiments. Indeed, many Experimental Alchemists may not be Alchemists at all, but rather <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Clerics">Clerics</a> or <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Magician">Magicians</a> who have made contact with higher powers (sec Section @#$ for more information on Divine Alchemy).</p>
<p>Experimental Alchemy can potentially involve a lot of quests. Parties of adventurers may make deals with an Experimental Alchemist, trading their services at acquiring rare ingredients for the Alchemist's items. This should save the adventurers about 30% on the cost (shown on the treasure tables in <a href="#TC_9.0">Section 9.0</a>) of the items because they will still probably have to pay the Alchemists, and will not be in all likelihood be gathering all of the substances necessary for the item. Many adventures can be had as parties roam the countryside in search of arcane ingredients.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of Experimental Alchemy, GMs may want to consider some modifications to the rules under <a href="#TC_9.0">Section 9.0</a> for Item Costs. Experimental Alchemy may only go to 10<sup>th</sup> or 20<sup>th</sup> level in ability, or may get much more expensive beyond a certain point. Master Alchemists (see below) may be very low in level, which would make items much more expensive. GMs may also want to ignore the rules that make magical items superior in nature, and possibly get rid of the rule that doubles the strength of all magical items. Command words may be very long, or long rituals may have to be performed just to make the items work. GMs may also want to limit the base lists available to Experimental Alchemists. Some may only do potions, while others may only make weapons. Basically, the danger, the high expense oftime and money, and the unreliability should be the hallmarks of this sort of alchemy.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/3.2.3/ROYAL ALCHEMY" -->
<h3><a name="TC_3.2.3">3.2.3</a> ROYAL ALCHEMY</h3>
<p>These types of alchemists work exclusively for a noble, or in rare cases simply a wealthy, patron. They are considered valued retainers, and are paid both in gold and in appropriate lodgings and amenities for their services. They may hold important positions such as "Grand Vizier" or "Astrologer" for their patron (in addition to their duties as purveyor of magical items). Royal Alchemists will only rarely produce items for people other than their patron. They have a job, after all, and do not have to look for work. If they do take up outside commissions, it is almost certainly done with the full knowledge and consent of their patron.</p>
<p>Royal Allchemists are seen as a sign of wealth and standing. In most kingdoms where these sorts ofalchemists exist, it may be illegal for them to work for anyone who is not of noble birth and who possesses a certain amount of landed titles. Access to magical items is just one of the many privileges that these nobility jealously guard.</p>
<p>Just as jealously as they guard these privileges, nobles are just as hkely to restrict the access that people have to their Alchemists. Alchemists could be bribed or even stolen offby other nobles. Works of power could be stolen, or worse yell, their designs stolen and then matching items could appear at the next dance or feast. The prospect of financial loss, personal danger or embarrassment, and loss of social standing ifhis Alchemist was killed or kidnapped will lead most nobles to let few people near these prized servants.</p>
<p>Because their clientele is of a certain social standing, a social standing that does not generally find themselves on the adventuring trail, a campaign exclusively designed around this type of alchemist will have a much higher percentage of magical "general" items. That is, there will be far more items that protect against poison, add to social skills, and perhaps provide defensive bonuses against assassins, than there will be simple swords. After all, though most nobles will have a weapon or three created for themselves, if they need more protection from physical violence they can raise a larger contingent of guards. The main danger these people face is not from trolls, but assassins in the middle of the night. And then there is Milady's need for that +10 set of cosmetics....</p>
<p>Royal Alchemists will also be much more likely to create items from precious metals and gems than they are with base substances. Magical items are as much for show as for utility, and their appearance is of paramount importance. It is not enough to have a plain sword that is made of magical high steel; the sword must be chased in silver or gold and set with precious gems. Further, because it is more expensive and takes more skill to enchant the gems and gold as weill as the steel, patrons are far more likely to demand that the items their Alchemists create be fully enchanted. This increases the bragging rights for owning such an item.</p>
<p>In this sort of campaign, the access to such items by the players should be fairly limited. GM's may wish to apply a negative modifier to all rolls on the Item Treasure Table to reflect the fact that fewer items are likely to be produced, let alone get out in the field to be found by adventurers. Also, unless the adventurers have the appropriate social standing, there may be problems if they openly display their finds. Guards may be under orders to detain any items that might be of the appropriate appearance</p>
<p>If players do get access to an Alchemist, it is probably only after intense negotiations with their patron. The patron will want to know just what the item is, what it will do, why the adventurers desire it, can they pay for the material cost and the time of his Alchemist, and just what arc they willing to do in return for the favor of taking up time that could well go for another +5 collar for the Lord's prized hunting hound. Once an appointment has been secured, it could still be months before the Alchemist could begin work, and there is every reason to believe that their work will be abandoned if the noble has a more pressing need such as a set of golden shoes that add +10 to <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Dancing">Dancing</a> maneuvers, or a divan that glows when an enemy sits on it.</p>
<p>Royal Alchemists may also be fairly limited in what sort of items they can create. They will not have easy access to other spell users that are not directly in the service of their patron, so they may well be limited to only open and closed spell lists in their realm. If their patron also has a spell user in his employ that has the spells the players desire to have imbedded, their services will probably have to be negotiated separately from the basic services of the Alchemist.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/3.2.4/GUILD ALCHEMISTS" -->
<h3><a name="TC_3.2.4">3.2.4</a> GUILD ALCHEMISTS</h3>
<p>Guild Alchemists are Alchemists that belong to an economic organization known as a guild, though this category can also include any confederation of Alchemists (e.g., monastic orders, where Alchemists bond to gather for the purposes of practicing their art). Guild Alchemists generally produce magical items for sale to the public or to a limited clientele. They are bound to respect the tenants of their order and may be precluded by their order from creating certain types of items.</p>
<p>Guilds are hierarchical structures whose purpose is to monopolize the production and selling of items in a certain geographical area. It is generally illegal for anyone but a guild to produce magical items in areas where Alchemy guilds exist. There might be exceptions to this, such as a monastic order that produces items for a particular deity's servants, but such exceptions will be rare. Guilds houses are generally only found in large cities, though they may have control over much larger geographical areas. If the guild is large enough, they may have smaller guild houses in smaller cities. Such houses will generally only be staffed by one Master and a few journeymen and apprentices. It is generally considered something of a punishment to be sent off to such a guild house.</p>
<p>Guilds generally produce items on a commission basis only. Magical items are very expensive commodities and come in too much variety for there to be anything like standard items ready to be purchased off the shelf. Though certain guilds may gain a reputation for the creation of certain items, this is probably because many people have been coming to them for a particular type of item rather than because they have such items on hand and available.</p>
<p>Guilds are sometimes the source of Royal Alchemists. In societies where there are independent guilds, nobles may still have a need for retainers that produce items for their use and enjoyment. It is offar greater benefit to hire out one of their members on a permanent basis to a local baron than it is to hope someone comes along to hire him. Besides, it gives the guild someone who may be privy to the baron's interests and thinking, and who could put in a favorable word when the guild has need of the nobles aide.</p>
<p>Besides nobles, merchant houses or other guilds may also have regular needs. Local officials, priest, and other interested parties may also make pressing demands. Even if a party can find a city with a guild house it may be months before construction can begin on their item. Guilds will generally reserve a spot for a clients item with 10% down, though it is standard to have 50% paid before construction will begin. If a client cannot pay the 50% before the time that construction was supposed to begin, the client usually has the choice of waiting until whoever's item was next on the list is done or getting his money back and going elsewhere. Because this may add many months to construction time in terms of just finding another guild with the time and expertise to make the item, most clients simply forfeit their spot.</p>
<p>The balance of the item's costis almost always due upon completion of the item (at which time the item is delivered). If the client cannot pay the remaining money, the guild will most likely attempt legal action against the client. Because guilds tend to have powerful aHies among local nobility, judgments tend to be swift. Guilds will normally attempt to seize any property owned by the client, which will be sold at public auction (sometimes along with the created item). Quite a few clients have found themselves paupers after attempting to renege on a guild contract.</p>
<p>Alchemy guilds tend to be large organizations that contain many skilled craftsmen in addition to the actual Alchemists. Most guilds will have their own smiths, glass blowers, jewelers, leather workers, and other craftsmen that make the items necessary for the Alchemists' work. These craftsmen are usually members of the Alchemist guild and do not do work for any other source. Alchemy guilds will generally have a large staff of servants to handle the day-to-day needs of the Alchemists. Such staffposition is usually hereditary and all such folk live in the guild house. This gives the guilds a source of potential recruits and prevents at least some loss of items and materials that could wander away each night as servants returned home.</p>
<p>As for the Alchemists themselves, they are generally organized into a standardized hierarchy. At the bottom are the apprentices. These children usually begin training at around age ofeight and serve until the of age sixteen. Most of their duties involve cleaning, fetching, carrying, and generally doing whatever their Master wants. In between chores, they are given some training by their teacher, though most will probably have to spend long hours studying on their own time to actually acquire enough knowledge to become Journeymen. Journeymen are usually young students (most around the age of sixteen to twenty-four) who have acquired the basic skills necessary to become functioning Alchemists, but who lack the ability to be truly called a Master. Journeymen normally have commissions assigned to them, and are usually considered paid professionals (working with a variety of Masters on different projects).</p>
<p>Once they havc acquircd cnough skill to pass a test of mastery, and the money necessary to purchase their Masterhood, journeymen normally become Masters. The test is usually the creation of an item that shows off all the abilities of the journeyman and is of the highest power level that the journeyman can produce. If the work is found to be good enough by a majority of the Masters of the guild, it is christened a masterwork, the journeymen pays his fee, and joins the company of Masters.</p>
<p>Masters usually get the best commissions and, consequently, produce the most powerful items. This is because guild usually gives half the price of the item sold to the Alchemist working on the item (the other half spent on replacing materials). As such, Masters generally pass lower powered creations to journeymen and reserve the more powerful and costly items for themselves.</p>
<p>Above the Masters there is almost always a GuiIdmaster. The Guildmaster is generally the most powerful Alchemist in the guild, though there are certainly times when a Guildmaster is the most politically adept instead of the most potent. Guildmasters generally take the most valuable of commissions, though they will sometimes refrain from taking commissions at all due to political situations. A Guildmaster is normally in charge of the guild's financial contracts and, in theory, in charge of the daily operation of the guild. However, most Guildmasters have less to do with the day-to-day activities, preferring to let servants handle these tasks.</p>
<p>Guilds are, fundamentally, political organizations. They seek to control the production of certain items, and restrict availability to keep prices high. Players will often have to curry favor with a guild and its members in order to get items created. If the guild dislikes an individual, it may be very hard to get magical items created. It may likewise be hard to buy normal items, because if the guild makes it known that it is displeased with an individual, many others may not sell to the character for fear of attracting the guild's wrath.</p>

<h3><a name="TC_3.2.5">3.2.5</a> MIXING ALCHEMY TYPES</h3>
<p>As noted earlier, there is no reason that different alchemical themes can not cxist simultaneously in the same game. Though GMs arc warned that this mixing of alchemy types can lead to a great number of headaches due to the complexity involved, elaborate tapestries can be constructed by GMs in which items of divine and secular origin can exist side by side, each contributing a particular feel to a world.</p>
<p>An example of this might be a world where most of the items are created by human mages, but where great items of power were created in the past by gods or other races. Perhaps the secret to creating these items has been lost, or the world has changed in some way that prevents them from being made. Either way, a few rare items with great power can add spice to a campaign. Great quests or wars might be fought for these artifacts. Whole campaigns can be run with these sorts of items as a backdrop, the players caught up in power plays by nobles, churches, and mortal Alchemists who want to possess these artifacts for their own purposes. Players could be loyal retainers, fanatics, hired hands, or the seekers of the artifacts themselves.</p>
<p>Because there arc nornlal magical items created by human mages, a GM would have to go to great lengths to separate these items from the artifacts. One of the best ways is to make sure no one knows exactly what the artifacts do. Players might discover records pointing to vast powers, or special purposes. There may be tales of all sorts of abilities, or, better yet, that the owner of the item gains powers keyed in some way to himself (i.e., each possessor has a different set of powers granted by the item). GMs can vary these tales from region to region or bard to bard. Because no one knows just all of what they can do, the GM has perfect freedom to change powers and abilities of the item from time to time, tailoring its powers to the needs of the story. For an ironic touch, it might turn out that the item does not actually do anything at all, its every power a fable, its every purpose a story.</p>
<p>One thing for a GM to consider when deciding which themes to use is the nature of the game world that he is running. Greater Alchemy tends to be found in worlds where epic quests are important. Experimental Alchemy, on the other hand, may be more appropriate in worlds where magic is uncommon or where the established magicians fear the effect items might have on their own income. Who needs to hire a mage for a job if they can get an item that will do it on command? Royal Alchemy is more likely to be found in areas where the nobles have great power and all other classes defer to them. Guild Alchemy is likely to arise in areas where there is a strong middle class such as large cities or in democratic political systems.</p>
<p>One thing to remember is that theme, not power level, is what determines what sort of Alchemy is appropriate for a particular world. Alchemy guilds will form in areas where there are other guild interests since alchemists will seek the same political advantages other tradesmen have. If nobles are respected above all, then even the most powerful Alchemist will seek the protection of a wealthy and powerful patron. Ifthe same Alchemist's works are dangerous enough, even wealthy nobles will consider at least sending them off to the hinterlands so their works can still be accessed but offer no danger to the patron. It is certainly possible for a GM to have a world where Alchemy guilds produce the items for sale in the cities, where most nobles have a personal alchemist, where there are groups of incompetent hedge wizards offering experimental items in the countryside, and the gods still create items to serve their own needs and those of their followers.</p>

<h2><a name="TC_3.3">3.3</a> ALCHEMICAL POWER LEVEL</h2>
<p>It is entirely up to the GM as to just how powerful is "powerful" in his campaign. It is a subject that only the GM can resolve and one that deserves a great deal of thought. After all, if in a particular GM' s world there are no +15 or greater magical weapons, then a +10 magical sword is likely to be an artifact of extreme power. GMs who wish to limit the power of magical items in such a manner may also wish to not allow certain of the special alloys such as high steel or white alloy in order to retain magic items as being of particular value. After all, is a +10 magical item really worth that much if you can have a +20 normal item?</p>
<p>For the purposes of this supplement, the following power structure has been assumed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An Apprentice Alchemist is 1<sup>st</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> level.</p></li>
<li><p>A Journeyman is 6<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> level.</p></li>
<li><p>A Master Alchemist is 11<sup>th</sup> to 20<sup>th</sup> level. A Royal Alchemist, regardless of level, is considered to be a Master Alchemist, though costs for 21<sup>st</sup> to 50<sup>th</sup> level items still increase (see <a href="#TC_9.0">Section 9.0</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>A Guild Master 21<sup>st</sup> to 30<sup>th</sup> level.</p></li>
<li><p>A Legendary Master Alchemist is 31<sup>st</sup> to 40<sup>th</sup> level.</p></li>
<li><p>A Legendary Guild Master Alchemist is greater than 40<sup>th</sup> level.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The assumption here is that most Alchemists are either apprentices of journeymen and that most items found are from 1<sup>st</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> level in power. It is assumed that there are no more than a dozen or so Legendary Masters in a world and maybe one or two Legendary Guild Masters. Depending on how you allocate Alchemists, there might only be one Alchemist of Guild Master class per city of 50,000 or greater inhabitants, Masters will probably not be found in cities of less than 10,000 people, and journeymen may not be found in cities of less than 5,000 people.</p>
<p>These numbers are arbitrary and may be entirely wrong for certain campaigns; GMs are advised to think about the power level of their world and make whatever adjustments they see fit. If there are no Alchemists over 20<sup>th</sup> level, or if a GM feels that Masters should be 20<sup>th</sup> level, make the necessary adjustments. <a href="#TC_12.0">Section 12.0</a> has been provided to help in this task. GMs are free to indicate just how expensive items are in their campaign as well as decide just how powerful such items can be in their campaigns.</p>

<h2><a name="TC_3.4">3.4</a> MATERIAL STRENGTH</h2>
<p>Material composition has a great deal of effect on the characteristics of weapons and armor. If enough money can be spent, items of exceptional quality can be made by a smith of proper training. In the <em>RMSS</em>, the following materials are available for non-magical weapons and armor.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/3.4.1/BRONZE" -->
<h3><a name="TC_3.4.1">3.4.1</a> BRONZE</h3>
<p>Bronze is an alloy of one part tin to nine parts copper. It is expensive to make, judging from the fact that the material worth of bronze is ten times that of copper,. Bronze is commonly used for household items that require a hard metal that can be cast easily and has a pleasing appearance. Bronze is often brittle, though it holds an edge well. Consequently, it is not normally used for weapons once the ability to make steel is available to a society. It was the metal of choice, however, for many early cultures before the development of smelting processes for iron and steel.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/3.4.2/STEEL" -->
<h3><a name="TC_3.4.2">3.4.2</a> STEEL</h3>
<p>With the exception of certain items (such as clubs, which are routinely made from wood), most weapons found in fantasy worlds are made of steel. Steel is an alloy of iron and other materials, though it will always include some amount of carbon. The basic purpose behind the use of steel is to produce a tough blade that will hold a serviceable edge. Iron by itself is soft and will not hold a cutting edge for long periods. While it is useful to hand cluhs or to cap quarter staves, iron is far from the substance of choice for a bladed weapon.</p>
<h5><a name="TC_3.4.2.0.1">3.4.2.0.1</a> Carbon Steel</h5>
<p>Carbon steel is the material most appropriate to fantasy worlds. Modern alloys (such as many stainless steels) require very carefully controlled conditions to actually heat treat and temper them, and such conditions are usually beyond the technological level of most fantasy worlds. Carbon steels, on the other hand, have been produced on Earth for thousands of years. They are alloys of iron and carbon. The percentage of carbon is expressed as a point of carbon. Each point signifies 0.01 percent of the alloy.</p>
<p>To produce a blade with enough hardness to hold an edge, a minimum of 40 points of carbon are needed. Such an edge will not last long, however, and steels with 60 to 70 points of carbon are considered to be the best range. Such steels produce the best balance of hardness and toughness. Beyond 70 points of carbon steel becomes very hard and brittle. While it will retain a marvelous edge, it will be very prone to shatter.</p>
<p>Carbon and iron are not the only materials found in many steels. Indeed, due to primitive working conditions, it is hard to produce an alloy that is free from some impurities. Some, but not all, of the other materials that may be present in steel by design or accident are as follows: manganese, nickel, chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, silicon, tungsten, sulfur, lead, and phosphorus. By varying the amounts of these ingredients a smith can increase the potential hardness, toughness, ductility, wear resistance, and thermal properties of the steel.</p>
<p>In the <em>RMSS</em> there are five general categories of steel that are available. Keep in mind that these are general categories that cover a wide range of steel alloys. The first category of steel is called hard iron. Hard iron is steel with 30 to 50 points of carbon. This very low carbon content is produced by either very poor steel making techniques or, more often, by accident. Before the invention of the blast furnace, carbon had a tendency to leach into the iron during the smelting process. While such alloys are better than soft iron for weapon making, they do not compare in sharpness to more advanced steels.</p>
<p>Most steel that is intentionally made, rather than accidentally happening in the smelting process, is considered to be low carbon steel (50 to 60 points). These alloys are easy to make are tough, and hold a serviceable edge. High carbon steels are harder to work and produce. They contain 60 to 70 points of carbon. White alloys cover a range of specialty steels that include manganese, tungsten, and other minerals. Its carbon content is usually at least 70 points. Due to the advanced techniques that would be required to produce them, white alloys may not be allowed in all campaigns. Black alloys contain either nickel or molybdenum, with large percentages of tungsten and vanadium. Due to the toughness of the other metals that make up black alloys, its carbon content is usually over 100 points to allow it to take a proper edge. It is incredibly difficult to forge and may not be available in all campaigns.</p>

<h3><a name="TC_3.4.3">3.4.3</a> SOFT IRON</h3>
<p>Iron is a tough mineral that is easy to cast and very tough. It is not generally used for cutting weapons, as it cannot be forged to hold an edge, though some work with a file can produce an edge that will serve for a short while. Its toughness, however, makes it eminently suitable for the creation of cheap maces and other concussion weapons.</p>

<h3><a name="TC_3.4.4">3.4.4</a> STONE</h3>
<p>Hard stones such as granite or flint are sometimes used by primitive peoples to create weapons such as club heads and spear points. Though quite dangerous, such items pale in comparison to metals. <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#TC_T-7.1">Table 7.1</a> lists the effects of making a weapon out of stone.</p>

<h3><a name="TC_3.4.5">3.4.5</a> WOOD</h3>
<p>Quite possibly the first substance Humans used as a weapon, wooden weapons such as clubs and quarterstaves are used in many societies. Wood is also important for making bows and light crossbows (heavy crossbows require steel to produce their incredible pull weights). Quarterstaves and clubs are considered +0 weapons if made out of ash or some other medium strength hardwood. <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#TC_T-7.2">Table 7.2</a> lists the effects on quarterstaves and clubs if they are made out of other types of wood. <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#TC_T-7.1">Table 7.1</a> lists the effects of making all other weapons out of wood. Quarterstaves and clubs may have their material strength increased by either banding them with steel (which adds half of the material strength bonus to the club or staff), or may be made out of a type of wood that is tough enough to have a material bonus.</p>

<p>Dyr Wood is a magical wood taken from the dead bodies of Ents, Deathwoodes, Awakened Trees, etc. Dyr Wood is unique in that it is a magical sponge and gets harder as more magic is placed in it. Unless the wood is worked in conjunction with a <em>Weapon</em> spell, it will have a Material Bonus of +0, and a Strength Bonus of +0.

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/4.2/USING TREASURE COMPANION WITH SPELL LAW" -->
<h2><a name="TC_4.2">4.2</a> USING TREASURE COMPANION WITH SPELL LAW</h2>
<p><em>Treasure Companion</em> provides new rules for the creation of magical items, Lord Research, and Alchemical spells. It effectively replaces <a href="5522.html#SL_7.4">Spell Law sections 7.4</a> (Alchemist Lists and Item creation), and <a href="5522.html#SL_9.2">9.2, (Alchemist Base Lists)</a></p>
<p>One area where <em>Treasure Companion</em> may cause a great deal of change is the nature of certain <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> spells. The <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> Alchemy list <em>Holy Works</em> defines the effects of Holy water and adds the concept of vestment spells. The spell <em>Holy Water</em>, on the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Cleric">Cleric</a> Base list <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html#SL_2.4.1">Channels</a>, should now be called <em>Holy Water I</em> and read as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1"><p><strong>Holy Water I (Fv)</strong> Converts 4 oz. of clear spring water to holy water. Holy water is used for ceremonies and to combat Undead: they take " A " heat criticals (or some other type, OM discretion, if the creature is immune to heatcriticals)whensplashed with4oz.ofholywater. If more than 4 oz. is splashed on an undead at once, each additional 4 oz. yields a -5 to the creature's Resistance Rolls. The water should be stored in fine crystal vials intended specifically for holy water storage. Holy water produced by the followers of evil deities has the same effects as holy water produced by good deities, though GMs should feel free to change this if they so wish (it could, for example, effect only good spirits).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Vestment spells are spells that require Channelers to be wearing a set of holy robes (A T 2). These garments are used for religious functions and enable their wearer to cast spells of a ritualistic, or religiously significant nature. Due to their religious nature, GMs may wish to rule that certain Base <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Cleric">Cleric</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Paladin">Paladin</a>, and Evil Cleric lists are contain spells that should be considered vestment spells. GMs are free to decide that whether <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Animist">Animists</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Ranger">Rangers</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Healer">Healers</a>, and <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Sorcerer">Sorcerers</a> should also have vestment spells, but since most of these classes can be considered to draw their power from sources other than deities (e.g., <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Animist">Animists</a> and <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Ranger">Rangers</a> might draw their power from nature spirits, <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Healer">Healers</a> mayor may not have a specific Divine patron, and <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Sorcerer">Sorcerers</a> might draw their power from a variety of extra-planar sources) <em>Treasure Companion</em> does not assume that they will have vestment spells.</p>
<p>If a GM rules that certain classes have vestment spells, the first issue he must deal with is just how these classes will acquire their vestments. One approach is to require that all holy vestments be made by a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Channeling-based_Alchemist"><span id="channeling">Channeling</span> Alchemist</a>. This approach assumes that each deity will have Channelers of several classes including <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Channeling-based_Alchemist"><span id="channeling">Channeling</span> Alchemist</a>. When a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Cleric">Cleric</a> or <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Paladin">Paladin</a> needs to acquire a vestment he simply goes to the Alchemists who sever his deity and asks for one. This approach works well in worlds where churches are highly organized and bureaucratic. It does have drawbacks, however, most notably that if a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Cleric">Cleric</a> has his vestment soiled while on campaign, it may not be possible to return to his order to obtain a new one for some time.</p>
<p>Another approach would be to allow other <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> users to create their own vestments. <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Paladin">Paladins</a> would not be able to create their own vestments (since their focus is much more active than the other holy spell users; besides, they lack a convenient place on their Base lists to put a vestment spell) and would have to rely on those spell users of their order that could. If GMs take this option, then the following spell would appear at 2<sup>nd</sup> level on <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html#SL_2.4.2">Communal Ways</a> (<a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Cleric">Cleric</a> Base) and 1<sup>st</sup> level on <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html#SL_2.8.2">Dark Channels</a> (Evil Cleric Base):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Holy Vestment (P)</strong> Consecrates vestment (AT 2) for usage of many spells on this and other lists. A caster may only have one vestment at a time, and to be usable it must be clean (i.e.., excessive dirt, sweat, etc. will make the vestment unusable until cleaned and the vestment is consecrated again with the <em>Holy Vestment</em> spell).</p>
</ul>
<p>If a GM does decide to use vestments the following spells should be considered Vestment spells:</p>

<h1><a name="TC_6.0">6.0</a> BUYING AND SELLING MAGICAL ITEMS</h1>
<p>After considering what sorts of Alchemists exist, and consequently what types ofitems are likely to be produced, another topic that a GM needs to consider is just how these items were purchased in the first place. Depending on the type of Alchemy in a campaign, someone probably had to pay for the production ofthese items in the first place. How these items were bought can effect what sorts of access the players will have to these items.</p>
<p>How items are sold is also a topic that can have a great deal of relevance for a particular campaign. Just how much will people pay for a used item? What sorts of payment arrangements they are capable ofmaking? These topics are of great interests to players and NPCs who have extra items in their hands and want to turn them into some much needed cash.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/6.1/SELLING" -->
<h2><a name="TC_6.1">6.1</a> SELLING</h2>
<p>When a GM has considered just what sorts of items exist in his world, he is presented with a second problem; what happens if once they get into the hands of the players the players want to sell them. In addition to the considerations from <a href="5521.html#GL_12.4.2"><em>Gamemaster Law</em> (Section 12.4.2)</a>, a GM must contend with the structure that he has established for his world's Alchemists.</p>
<p>If all of the Alchemy in his world is Greater Alchemy, it may not be feasible to let the players sell items at all. Religious groups might get upset when their great holy item is put up for auction. Perhaps the elven nation would like the item it lent the players back. The great mystery behind the item's powers may not attract buyers, or worse yet only attract those willing to steal or kill to possess the item. Ifone can sell it at all, one may have to accept land (being the only commodity that can approach the value of such items) which may not be the sort of currency the adventurers were hoping for.</p>
<p>Items from worlds where Experimental Alchemy is the main type of Alchemy may also be prove difficult to sell.. Buyers may be very reluctant to purchase a device that might blow up in their hands. Prices are generally low, especially in the resale market, because buyers are even less sure just where the item comes from or what problems may be inherited with it.</p>
<p>Worlds with Royal Alchemy present their own special problems. To begin with, it may not be legal for the players to own magical items at all. They could also be restricted to sell such items only to nobles. Even if they can sell such items to the general public, there is no pedigree to go along with the item. In societies where magical items are valued for their artistic merit and the name of the Alchemist who made it as well as their functionality, a player may find it hard to pass off a sword that he just dug out of the ground as an item worth buying even if it does do incredible things.</p>
<p>Guild Alchemy also presents problems to players. To begin with, it might only be legal to sell items to a guild or its representatives. Guilds may only give payment in services, rather than cash. In such cases where they do give cash, the guild will probably not offer much, so players who want a better return may well have to deal with black market forces, members of which may find it easier to try and steal the item rather than pay the characters for it. Even if one can sell the item legally, the Alchemist guilds will be doing their utmost to try and instill the message that one should not buy an item just found laying about. Who knows what it will do? Guilds may foster an atmosphere where it is felt to be better to buy from them rather than run off to some person who claims to have an item of power he dug up out of the ground.</p>
<p>Besides these considerations, there is the problem of paying a character for his items. In societies where Basic Wealth is the only form of wealth, it may be very hard to find a buyer who actually has both the cash and the desire to pay for an item. A noble might well sell a guild a herd of cattle as part ofa deal, but adventurers may not find this sort of wealth to be to their liking. In societies with banks, it might be possible for the buyer to get a loan or to just have his bank issue a draft, but such payment is only as good as the bank that issues it.</p>

<h2><a name="TC_6.2">6.2</a> MAGICAL ITEM PURCHASE/SALE CHARTS</h2>
<p>The following charts have been provided to specifically handle the problems of buying and selling magical items. One key concept to buying an item is its availability. An item's availability starts at medium for an apprenticeship level item and increases by one for every class higher (e.g., journeyman items are hard, master items are very hard, etc.). The availability rating of an item also goes up for each extra ability in the item.</p>

<h2><a name="TC_7.1">7.1</a> WEAPONS</h2>
<p>Weapons can be modified in a variety of ways to increase value and effectiveness. These factors include material composition, superiordesign, and modified weight. Cost modifiers are added together and then multiplied by the base cost of the item (e.g., a superior-designed high steel weapon, for example, would have a cost multiplier of 55, which is the sum of the modifier for being of superior sesign (x5), and the modifier for being made of high steel (x50)). Separate Smithing maneuver rolls are required for each modifier with a failure botching the entire project.</p>

<h3><a name="TC_7.1.1">7.1.1</a> SUPERIOR DESIGN</h3>
<p>This is a broad category ofimprovements.This categoryis intended to represent the effects of pattern welding (welding steels ofdiffering strengths together to produce a blade), fullering (creating longitudinal grooves to lighten and strengthen the blade), care in balancing and forging, and other factors. Individually these elements are rarely enough to produce a superior designed blade. Indeed, most cultures including the Vikings and Japanese, relied on pattern welding to make all of their blades before the development of more modern steels. Likewise, many European blades had extensive fullering. Only in combination with the skill of a master smith do these elements combine to produce a superior blade. <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#TC_7.3">Table 7.3</a> lists the costs and effects of superior weapon design. The initiative bonus only applies to the actual attack actions and not to other actions taken in the round.</p>

<p>The weight of a weapon may be modified to be greater or lesser than the average range specified by Weapon Table in <a href="5500A.html#RMSR_A-8.0">Appendix 8 of <em>RMSR</em></a>. The trick to such a modification is to preserve the fighting characteristics of the blade while reducing or increasing the amount of material used in its construction. This process has two effects. First it either increases or decreases the amount of exhaustion used while exercising the proper fighting techniques for the weapon.Secondly, itincreases ordecreases the strength of the weapon. <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#TC_7.4">Table 7.4</a> lists the effects of modified weight weapons.</p>

<h2><a name="TC_7.2">7.2</a> ARMOR</h2>
<p>Like weapons, armor can also be modified in a variety of ways to change its value and effectiveness. These factors include material composition, superior design, and modified weight. Cost modifiers are added together and then multiplied by the base cost of the item. Separate <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Smithing">Smithing</a> maneuver rolls are required for each modifier with a failure hotching the entire project.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/7.2.1/MATERIAL COMPOSITION" -->
<h3><a name="TC_7.2.1">7.2.1</a> MATERIAL COMPOSITION</h3>
<p>Substances used in the making of armor have the main requirement of being tough. Materials must be durable enough to absorb damage without breaking, but hard enough so that they cannot be easily penetrated. The material must be molded and shaped in a variety of ways. Though exotic materials such as bamboo and hardwoods are occasionally used for armor, most areas of the world choose either leathers or metals to meet these requirements.</p>
<p>Armor types 9-12 are considered to be made of rigid leather. Rigid leather is leather that is boiled in oil to make it harder and more resistant to blows. Leather treated in this manner can he molded in a variety of shapes to form rigid plates.</p>
<p><a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#TC_T-7.5">Table 7.5</a> gives the cost and effects of the materials suited to particular armor types.</p>

<h3><a name="TC_7.2.2">7.2.2</a> SUPERIOR DESIGN</h3>
<p>Superior armor design comes about through a combination of advanced techniques, pure alloys, and smithing skill. It decreases the armor penalties of the armor type (though the penalties cannot go above zero). <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#TC_T-7.6">Table 7.6</a> lists the costs and effects of superior designed armor.</p>

<h3><a name="TC_7.2.3">7.2.3</a> MODIFIED WEIGHT</h3>
<p>Through advanced smithing techniques armor may be lightened while retaining its ability to protect the wearer. Such techniques are very difficult, hut have the effect of producing armor that is far easier to maneuver in. To determine the exact effect, multiply the Armor Penalties by the weight percentage. This modifier is applied after the effects of superior design. <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#TC_T-7.7">Table 7.7</a> lists the costs and effects of modified weight armor.</p>

<h1><a name="TC_8.0">8.0</a> MAGICAL ITEMS</h1>
<p>Alchemists create items for a great variety of reasons. For some it is the pure enjoyment of creating something new. Others desire that their fame and power be known to others, and create items as a testament to such. Still others are trying to fulfill the economic needs and desires that exist in their world. Whatever the reason, all of them are harnessing the forces of their world in far more permanent ways than other spell users.</p><!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/8.1/LEVEL" -->
<h2><a name="TC_8.1">8.1</a> LEVEL</h2>
<p>An item's level is the highest level spell used in creating the item. This measure has several effects. It determines the duration and effects of the spells it that are imbedded in it. When determining bonuses for Base Attack Rolls (and Elemental Ball Attacks), the item's level is treated as the number of ranks in the spell list. The level of the item is also used as the attacker's level for purposes of Resistance Rolls resulting from the item's attack(s) (or target's level if the item must make an RR). It is treated as the number of ranks of the <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Directed_Spell">Directed Spell</a> skill (using the category progression) that an item has as a bonus to any bolt spells placed in it. It is important, however, to note that the level of an adder or a spell multiplier does not affect the spells that may be cast with the aid of these items.</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> A <em>Sudden Light</em> spell is imbedded in a <em>Daily V</em> item (a 14<sup>th</sup> level Item). Thus, when the user casts the <em>Sudden Light</em> he would add +14 to his Base Attack Roll, and the target would resist against a 14<sup>th</sup> level attack.</blockquote>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/8.2/CASTING REQUIREMENTS" -->
<h2><a name="TC_8.2">8.2</a> CASTING REQUIREMENTS</h2>
<p>Before casting a spell from an item, the caster must either make an <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Attunement">Attunement</a> maneuver to learn how to use the item. See the <a href="5500.html">RMSR</a> for the details in making the <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Attunement">Attunement</a> maneuver. Note that some items have command words that must be spoken out loud. Command words are a type of key (see <a href="#TC_8.7">Section 8.7</a>). Command words are not limited to spoken words, and may include gestures or pressing on the item in a certain way (though such ways must be visible to anyone making an <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Observation">Observation</a> maneuver). Learning an item's command word requires an Very Hard <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Attunement">Attunement</a> maneuver.</p>
<blockquote id="option"><strong>Option:</strong> Some GMs may want to require an <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Attunement">Attunement</a> maneuver each time an item is used.

<h2><a name="TC_8.3">8.3</a> CASTING TIME FROM ITEMS</h2>
<p>One of the advantages of casting a spell through an item is that it is always takes one round to cast the spell through the item. Though this slows down the use of instantaneous spells, it can greatly speed up other casting.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/8.4/MAGIC ITEM TYPES" -->
<h2><a name="TC_8.4">8.4</a> MAGIC ITEM TYPES</h2>
<p>Magical items can generally be divided into eight groups: armor and shields; charged items; daily and constant items; general items; potions; runes; single-use items; and weapons. Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages (which an Alchemist or his client must consider when creating or commissioning an item).</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/8.4.1/ARMOR AND SHIELDS" -->
<h3><a name="TC_8.4.1">8.4.1</a> ARMOR AND SHIELDS</h3>
<p>Magical armor and shields have several advantages. They are usually made lighter (85% weight) than normal armor and are considered to be of superior design (and gain all the benefits of superior design). They are stronger than normal armor and have a higher protective bonus than normal armor made out of the same material. Magical armor and shields can also have enchanted abilities imbedded in them which can increase their protective value or decrease their weight. Also, the main benefits of magical armor and shields are gained without the wearer making an <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Attunement">Attunement</a> maneuver (though he might have to make an <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Attunement">Attunement</a> maneuver to be able to use any special abilities that the armor has).</p>
<p>The main disadvantage of magical armor (though not magical shields) is that due to the amount of material that must be enchanted their base cost is five times that of other items.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/8.4.2/CHARGED ITEMS" -->
<h3><a name="TC_8.4.2">8.4.2</a> CHARGED ITEMS</h3>
<p>Charged items can be divided into three categories: wands, rods, and staffs. Wands are actually anyone foot long object (though they are usually made of wood), and can have a 1<sup>st</sup> or 2<sup>nd</sup> level spell imbedded in them. When fully charged, wands have 10 charges. Rods are any item between one foot and two and a half feet long (and are usually made of wood), and can have 1<sup>st</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> level spells imbedded in them. When fully charged, rods have 30 charges. Staves are actually any object between two feet and five feet long (are usually made of wood), and can have 1<sup>st</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> level spells imbedded in them. When fully charged, they have 100 charges.</p>
<p>Charged items have the advantage that they can be used again and again until they run out of charges, and can be recharged (though Alchemists will charge for this privilege at what ever rate is typical for a highly skilled NPC's services, though characters may want to invest in a device that casts <em>Charge Wand</em>, <em>Charge Rod</em>, or <em>Charge Staff</em> to avoid this difficulty). They also require about half the time to produce as items that function constantly, and more than one charged ability can be combined in an item (e.g., one could make a staff that casts both Lighting Bolts and Fire Bolts, though his requires two <em>Make Staff</em> spells, two Imbed spells of the appropriate levels, and two <em>Charge Staff</em> spells to be cast during the creation process).</p>
<p>Their disadvantages are that they are relatively large (especially especially if you want higher level spells), not especially tough, require some kind of command word to use. In addition, they can run out of charges when one needs them most. Finally, the user must have made an <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Attunement">Attunement</a> maneuver to use the item at all.</p>
<blockquote id="option"><strong>Option:</strong> GMs may wish to limit charged items to being made out of organic material only, and may prohibit them from being incorporated into other types of items (e.g., GMs may decide that one could not create a wooden shield that is also a Staff of Ice Bolts).</blockquote>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/8.4.3/DAILY AND CONSTANT ITEMS" -->
<h3><a name="TC_8.4.3">8.4.3</a> DAILY AND CONSTANT ITEMS</h3>
<p>These items either cast a particular spell a certain number of times a day (thus the term "daily"), or emit a particular spell constantly (thus the term "constant"). Daily items are rated by a number such as Daily I, Daily II, etc. The number indicates the maximum level spell that can be imbedded into the item during creation. If a spell is imbedded that is of lower level than the daily number, it can possibly function more than once a day. To determine how often, divide the daily number by the level of the spell and round down. Thus, a Daily III can have a 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> level spell imbedded in it. If the spell is 1<sup>st</sup> level it will work 3 times a day, and if it is 2<sup>nd</sup> or 3<sup>rd</sup> level it will work once a day. Constant items are created to have a spell always functioning, though it can be set to go off under limited circumstances (see below). An item that is set up to function "at will" is a constant item that is keyed to function when the wielder commands (though GMs may wish to not allow this kind of item if they feel that it is too powerful).</p>
<p>The advantage of daily and constant items is that they are very reliable. The wielder knows just how often they will work. Also, they can be made into many forms that are more durable than charged items. Daily items take much less time to create that constant Items do.</p>
<p>Their main disadvantage is the same as their advantage; they can only be used so often each day. Some GMs may wish to assign a time (e.g., Midnight) at which all devices will regain their charge; others may assign the recharge moment on an item by item basis. Higher level daily items and all constant items are very hard to produce (i.e., require higher level spells than imbedding the same level spell in a charged item, potion, etc.). All daily items and constant items made to function "at will" require a command word. GMs may also require that constant items require gems or magical materials for their magic to be imbedded in.</p>

<h3><a name="TC_8.4.4">8.4.4</a> GENERAL ITEMS</h3>
<p>General items add a bonus to skills (though not OB or DB, or they would be classified as a weapon or armor), add to the characters abilities (RRs, Hit Points, etc.), or add to the number of spells a character can cast (adders and multipliers).</p>
<p>Their advantages are that one does not need an <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Attunement">Attunement</a> maneuver (or command word) to use their abilities; they can be made out of any material (so can be very durable if the Alchemist wishes); and they allow Alchemists to create a great number of effects not directly reproducible with imbedded spells. In addition, an <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Attunement">Attunement maneuver</a> is not required to gain the bonus from the item (though the user may not realize the bonuse he is gaining). Remember that an <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Attunement">Attunement</a> maneuver would be needed to ascertain the nature of the item.</p>
<p>Their disadvantages are that they are very time consuming to produce. GMs may wish to limit just how their bonuses can be applied (e.g., a GM may wish to only allow bonuses to specific skills rather than Skill Categories).</p>

<h3><a name="TC_8.4.5">8.4.5</a> POTIONS</h3>
<p>Like single use items, potions only work on one occasion, though they have some advantages that single use items lack. Potions come in several forms, from watery liquids to oils, balms, and even incense. They must be drunk or applied for that person to gain the benefit of their effect.</p>
<p>Potions have the advantages in that they can be produced with up to 20<sup>th</sup> level spells, and can, with additional spells, even come in gaseous forms that do not require that they be directly applied or ingested. They do not require a command word or an <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Attunement">Attunement</a> maneuver to use. They require only one quarter of the time that it takes to produce a constant item. Also, unless they are a gas or an oil, if a potion's container is broken their effects are lost but do not necessarily affect whoever they spill on.</p>
<p>The disadvantage of a potion is that it only works once. In addition, the effects of potions cannot be ascertained by simply making an <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Attunement">Attunement</a> maneuver.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/8.4.6/RUNES" -->
<h3><a name="TC_8.4.6">8.4.6</a> RUNES</h3>
<p>Runes are spells placed on a sheet of rune paper. Rune paper is cheap to produce and is reusable. It comes in Ratings that specify the maximum level spell that can be placed in the paper.</p>
<p>The advantages ofrunes, or more specifically the advantage of rune paper, is that it can be used over and over. Unlike other items, a sheet of rune paper can also have different spells placed in it over time, so it gives its owner great versatility. Rune paper can also hold up to 50<sup>th</sup> level spells.</p>
<p>The disadvantage of runes are that they are very fragile, can only have one rune placed in a sheet at a given time, and that they require a <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Read_Runes">Read Runes</a> maneuver to use them (remember that the <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Read_Runes">Read Runes</a> maneuver is made to learn the information on the rune paper; no such maneuver is required to activate the paper once it is deciphered). Also, to place a spell on a sheet of rune paper one needs access to the Open <span id="essence">Essence</span> spell list, <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html#SL_3.1.8">Rune Mastery</a>, so they may not be easily renewable for many parties.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/8.4.7/SINGLE USE ITEMS" -->
<h3><a name="TC_8.4.7">8.4.7</a> SINGLE USE ITEMS</h3>
<p>This category could be considered a sub-category of charged items. In effect, they are charged items that work only once. Unlike charged item, however, they can be made out of any substance.</p>
<p>The advantage of single use items is that they are very cheap to produce compared to other items. They require one eighth the amount of time needed to product a constant item, and are correspondingly less expensive to make. Also, they are able to have up to 50<sup>th</sup> level spells imbedded in them, something only Runes can match.</p>
<p>Their disadvantage is held in their name; they only work once. They cannot be recharged. If they are to work when broken, players should be very careful not to let them go off by accident (or they could well suffer the effects from these items at very undesirable times).</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> Jan the Alchemist might create small glass beads which have <em>Sudden Light</em> spells (5<sup>th</sup> level spell from the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Magician">Magician</a> Base list, <a href="../en.lproj/spells.html#SL_3.4.4">Light Law</a>) imbedded in them. Because Jan cannot yet create a Daily V item, Jan decides to make five Single-use items instead. Jan further keys the items to release the <em>Sudden Light</em> spell when they are broken. Jan's idea is to loosely sew the beads onto the front of his robes and then just pull them off and use them as needed. Unfortunately for Jan, after offending the village smith at his local tavern, he is tossed head over heals into the walls of said tavern. The impact crushes the beads and releases all five <em>Sudden Lights</em> simultaneously. While this does bring the barfight to a sudden stop, it also sends poor Jan deeply into unconsciousness.</blockquote>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/8.4.8/WEAPONS" -->
<h3><a name="TC_8.4.8">8.4.8</a> WEAPONS</h3>
<p>Magical weapons add to the OB of their wielder. They are also able to be made in a variety of weights, are considered of superior design (and gain all of the benefits of superior design), and have half again the strength bonus oftheir non-magic counterparts. Further, various enchanted abilities may be imbedded in a weapon that cannot be reproducible through imbedded spells. They can also be made sentient (so they can use their abilities either in coordination with their wielder or at such times that their wielder becomes incapacitated).</p>
<p>The advantages of magical weapons are many. They have higher OB bonuses than a normal item made from the same material and are far more resistant to breakage. Their enchanted abilities can make them very versatile and dangerous. In addition, weapon items do not require that an <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Attunement">Attunement</a> maneuver be made to use the item (though the wielder may not realize the bonus he is getting). However, an <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Attunement">Attunement</a> may be required to use some of the special enchanted abilities of the weapon.</p>
<p>The disadvantage ofmagical weapons is the same as that of armor, general items, and constant items; they take the longest time to produce. Also, because each ability must be placed separately, the more abilities given to a weapon the more time it will take and the more it will cost. Intelligent weapons also have the drawback that if they do not like or at least philosophically disagree with their wielder, they may resist efforts to use them.</p>

<p>It is possible to combine the effects of several magical item categories into one item. The rules for this can be found under in <a href="#TC_10.0">Section 10.0</a>. GMs should carefully consider before allowing such combined items. They can greatly add to the power level of a campaign.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/8.6/FULLY AND PERTIALLY ENCHANTED ITEMS" -->
<h2><a name="TC_8.6">8.6</a> FULLY AND PARTIALLY ENCHANTED ITEMS</h2>
<p>For an item to be considered fully enchanted, all of its parts must have been worked with all the appropriate <em>Make</em> and/or <em>Work</em> spells necessary to enchant them. For example, a fully enchanted battle axe made of oak and low steel must have had both <em>Work Wood</em>, and <em>Work Low Steel</em> cast upon it; this is in addition to any actual abilities placed in the item. This allows the enchantments to be placed III the entire item and leads to an item with greater strength and decay resistance.</p>
<p>For the sake of economy, however, GMs may allow their Alchemists to create partially enchanted items. An item that is partially enchanted only has the relevant parts for its purposes actually worked with the appropriate <em>Make</em> and/or <em>Work</em> spells. Thus, only a sword's blade, an axe's head, a ring's gem, etc., would actually be enchanted. This leads to a large cost savings, though some items will be weaker for it (and GMs should be sure that this fact is always a danger).</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/8.7/KEYING" -->
<h2><a name="TC_8.7">8.7</a> KEYING</h2>
<p>Keying is a process that can take place during item creation. Specifically, it is the process by which an Alchemist restricts the abilities of an item. By means of this process, Alchemists can create items that will only work for certain classes, races, or when a specific circumstance happens. Keying does not cost anything to imbed (either in extra materials or in time).</p>
<p>In general, keys can be almost anything. For example, an item with a constant <em>Touch of Disruption</em> spell might be keyed so as not to affect its wielder (indeed, most harmful constant spells are assumed to be keyed in exactly this manner). It might also be keyed to function only when the item touches someone in combat, thereby preventing accidental damage to passers by. It could be further keyed to work only in the hands of a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Sorcerer">Sorcerer</a>. With a little creativity, an Alchemists can produce a great many effects.</p>
<p>There are, however, two keys that a GM may wish to not allow in his campaign. The first is an item keyed to only work for a particular individual. The problem with this particular key is that if it is possible to perform, it may become too common. After all, the chances of theft of an item that will only work for a particular person are very small. So many people would want this sort of key. It also has the advantage that one's enemy, even if he did steal an item, cannot use it against its rightful owner. This further increases its desirability. As such, it may well turn out that no items will be found without this key. Other than the base abilities of armor, swords, and general items, which cannot be keyed (though other abilities of the weapon can be keyed), there may be no other magical items in a world that would be usable by the players. In general, the narrowest restriction should be the race, profession, or vocation of a wielder.</p>
<p>The other key that a GM may seriously want to restricts is allowing an item that casts an area spell to be keyed not to affect its wielder. Many GMs may feel that this would stretch credibility too far, as well as giving the players too much power.</p>

<h2><a name="TC_9.1">9.1</a> THE COST OF MAKING MAGIC ITEMS</h2>
<p>The cost ofmaking magic items is detennined by several factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time (<a href="#TC_9.1.1">see below</a>)</li>
<li>Required spells and Power Points (see <a href="5522.html#SL_7.4.1">Sections 7.4.1</a>-<a href="5522.html#SL_7.4.3">7.4.3</a> in <em>Spell Law</em>)</li>

<li>Standard research costs if necessary (<a href="5522.html#SL_7.5">Section 7.5</a> in <em>Spell Law</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>These costs have been designed to make magic items difficult (but not outrageous) to buy. Note that the prices of such items, if ever sold, reflect these costs, including the time (perhaps years) the Alchemist worked on the items.</p>
<!-- AppleSegEnd -->
<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/9.1.1/TIME COST" -->
<h3><a name="TC_9.1.1">9.1.1</a> TIME COST</h3>
<p>Time is one of the key factors in the making of magical items. The time cost is given in tenns of a number of required consecutive weeks. Making a magic item consists of simultaneously:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Creating the base item</strong>&mdash;This costs one week per level of the spell used in creating the base item; see <a href="5522.html#SL_7.4.1">Section 7.4.1</a> in <em>Spell Law</em> for the list of required spells. The Make/Work spells used in this step allow the caster to make a flawless item. As such, they are considered superior in design to nonnal items in addition to their bonuses. This does not mean, however, that they are automatically objects of great beauty. For this the Alchemist still needs to use his various crafting skills. The spells nonnally cast for the base item are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Work <em>xxx</em> Spell</li>
<li>A Make <em>xxx</em> Spell (if there is one)</li>
<li>A <em>Make Wand</em>, <em>Rod</em>, or <em>Staff</em> spell (if there is one)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Placing an enchanted ability</strong>&mdash;There can be multiple enchanted abilities in an item; for the purposes of time (see below) treat each enchanted ability as a separate capability. See <a href="5522.html#SL_7.4.2">Section 7.4.2</a> in <em>Spell Law</em> for required spells. Only one spell from the Enchanting Ways list is nonnally required for each enchanted ability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Placing an imbedded spell</strong>&mdash;There can be multiple imbedded spells in an item; for the purposes of time cost (see below) treat each imbedded spell as a separate capability. See <a href="5522.html#SL_7.4.3">Section 7.4.3</a> in <em>Spell Law</em> for the list of required spells. The spells normally cast for an imbedded spell are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The spell imbedded</li>
<li>The <em>Imbed #</em> spell</li>
<li>The <em>Charge xxx</em>, <em>Daily #</em>, or <em>Constant</em> spell (if one).</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h5><a name="TC_9.1.1.0.1">9.1.1.0.1</a> Base Item Time Cost</h5>
<p>Creating the base item costs one week per level of the spell used in creating the base item.</p>
<h5><a name="TC_9.1.1.0.2">9.1.1.0.2</a> Capability Time Costs</h5>
<p>For these cost calculation purposes, a capability refers to an enchanted ability or an imbedded spell. Basically, the time required for each capability is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The first capability costs I week for each level of each spell cast for creating that capability.</p></li>
<li><p>The second capability costs 2 weeks for each level ofeach spell cast for creating that capability.</p></li>
<li><p>The third capability costs 3 weeks for each level of each spell cast for creating that capability.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5><a name="TC_9.1.1.0.3">9.1.1.0.3</a> Modifiers</h5>
<p>Certain types of items take less time to make. This is because these items function on a limited basis. Modifiers apply to specific capabilities of the item and affect the cost of the capability before taking into account what order the capability is given in. If the modifier applies to all of the capabilities of the item, it may be modify the base cost as well. Round the cost to the nearest week. The modifiers are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Item is a single use item: .125x time cost.</li>
<li>Item is a potion: .25x time cost.</li>
<li>Item is a charged item: .5x time cost.</li>
<li>Item is a daily item: .75x time cost.</li>
<li>Other item types: 1x time cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>To obtain the lowest cost, the creating Alchemist can choose which capability is first, which is second, etc. For the lowest cost, make the capability with the highest cost the first, make the capability with the second highest cost the second, etc.</p>
<blockquote id="example"><p><strong>Example:</strong> A 50<sup>th</sup> level Alchemist wishes to make: mithril hammer (requires a 15<em>th</em> level <em>Work Mithril</em> spell and a 50<em>th</em> level <em>Weapon V</em> spell) of Orc-slaying (requires a 15<sup>th</sup> level enchantment spell as determined by the GM). It would take 95 weeks to finish: 15 weeks for creating the base item; 50 weeks for the <em>Weapon V</em>; and 30 weeks for the Slaying ability.</p>
<p>If he also wanted to imbed a <em>Haste I</em> spell (1 charge) in the hammer (requires a 6<sup>th</sup> level <em>Haste I</em> spell to be imbedded and a 13<sup>th</sup> level <em>Imbed VI</em> spell), it would cost him more time:</p>
<pre>[15 weeks for the base item] 
+[50 weeks for the Weapon V] 
+[30 weeks for the Ore-slaying enchanted ability]+[6 weeksfor the Haste I (19 weeks, x 1/8 for a 
          single use item, x3 for the third capability)]
=15 + 50 + 30 + 6=101 weeks</pre></blockquote>
<blockquote id="example"><p><strong>Example:</strong> The same 50<sup>th</sup> level Alchemist wishes to make a Dragon Bone Rod. (Requires a 20<sup>th</sup> level <em>Work Organic True</em> and a 10<sup>th</sup> level <em>Make Rod</em> Spell). He also wishes to imbed a <em>Sudden Light</em> spell. (Requires a 5<sup>th</sup> Level spell to be imbedded an 8<sup>th</sup> level <em>Charge Rod</em> spell). He also wishes to enchant it to be a +2 spell adder (requires a 10<sup>th</sup> level <em>General II</em> spell) and enchant it to have a +10 combat bonus (requires a 8<sup>th</sup> level <em>Weapon II</em> spell). The cheapest cost total is:</p>
<pre>[30 weeks for the base item (Note: since not all of
    the capabilities of the rod are charged capabilities,

<h5><a name="TC_9.1.1.0.4">9.1.1.0.4</a> Distributing time Cost</h5>
<p>A GM may wish to allow this time cost to be distributed over several Alchemists if they are all capable of casting all of the Alchemist spells involved in the creation process. If this is allowed, however, the monetary cost of the item is still based off the time before distribution.</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> The rod above: takes one Alchemist 77 weeks, but would take 7 Alchemists 11 weeks if they worked together; provided all of them could cast <em>Work Mithril</em>, <em>Weapon V</em>, had researched Orc-slaying, and knew <em>Imbed VI</em> and <em>Haste I</em> spells. The monetary cost of the item, however, would still be based on 77 weeks of work, not 11 weeks.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="TC_9.1.2">9.1.2</a> REQUIRED SPELL CASTING COSTS</h3>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/9.1.3/MATERIALS AND MONEY" -->
<h3><a name="TC_9.1.3">9.1.3</a> MATERIALS AND MONEY</h3>
<p>All items have with them an associated materials and money cost. This cost represents the exotic materials, special equipment, and materials needed to make the item. These costs are represented by the levels of the spells involved in the creation of the item. There are no further modifiers for the type of item (say a sword as opposed to a dagger) because it is assumed that most of the cost of producing the item involves the rare and exotic materials, not the base cost of the item. GMs should feel free to add the base cost of the item back into this process if they wish.</p>
<h5><a name="TC_9.1.3.0.1">9.1.3.0.1</a> Base Cost</h5>
<p>The cost to produce the item is as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Base Cost</strong> = (Total levels of all spells necessary for the item) &times; (Total time in weeks needed to create the item) in gold.</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> The mithril hammer above: takes one alchemist 101 weeks, and requires 99 levels of spells to produce. This gives it a base cost of 9,999 gold.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Suits of armor produced via the Armor spells, as opposed to shields produced by the Armor spells, have their base price multiplied by five. GMs may also want to consider increasing the base costs of other large items such as carts, ships, castles, etc.</blockquote>
<h5><a name="TC_9.1.3.0.2">9.1.3.0.2</a> The Selling Price</h5>
<p>The cost of an item will also vary depending on the world system being used. To reflect this, the following modifiers are provided. These represent the effects of increasing costs of materials at higher levels and the requisite higher fees that Alchemists charge to produce items. It is assumed that half of the selling price goes to pay for the exotic materials necessary to produce the item, and the other half goes to pay the Alchemist. A GM will need to determine what level an Alchemist has to be before the cost modifier will be applied. The titles Apprentice, Journeymen, Master, and Guildmaster are used here to signify general levels of power. Legendary status is assumed to be passed on to only a handful of the most famous and powerful Alchemists. There are assumed to be only one or two Legendary Guildmasters in a world though GMs are, of course, free to disregard this. The modifiers and suggested levels to apply are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1x Base Price if the item requires an Apprentice Alchemist (1<sup>st</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> level) to produce;</p></li>
<li><p>2x Base Price if the item requires a Journeyman (6<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> level) to produce;</p></li>
<li><p>4x Selling Price if the item requires a Master Alchemist (11<sup>th</sup> to 20<sup>th</sup> level) to produce, or any item purchased from a Royal Alchemist of the same level of power;</p></li>
<li><p>8x Selling Price if the item requires a Guild Master (21<sup>st</sup> to 30<sup>th</sup> level) to produce, or any item purchased from a Royal Alchemist of the same level of power;</p></li>
<li><p>16x Selling Price if the item requires a Legendary Master Alchemist (31<sup>st</sup> to 40<sup>th</sup> level) to produce, or any item purchased from a Royal Alchemist of the same level of power;</p></li>
<li><p>32x Selling Price if the item requires a Legendary Guild Master Alchemist (41<sup>st</sup> to 50<sup>th</sup> level) to produce, or any item purchased from a Royal Alchemist of the same level of power;</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> The mithril hammer above has a base cost of 9,999 gold. The GM determines that in his world it would take an Alchemist of Master status to produce this item so this increases the selling cost to 39,996 gold. Had the GM determined that it would have taken a Legendary Master to produce the item it would have cost 319,968 gold.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> The Dragon Bone rod above: takes one alchemist 77 weeks, and requires 61 levels of spells to produce. This gives a base cost of 4,697 gold. The GM determines that in his world it would take an Alchemist of Master status to produce the item so this increases the selling cost to 18,788 gold. Had the GM determined that it would have taken a Legendary Master to produce the item it would have cost 150,304 gold.</blockquote>
<h5><a name="TC_9.1.3.0.3">9.1.3.0.3</a> Superior Items</h5>
<p>All magic items are assumed to be of superior construction. Thus, all magic weapons have a bonus of +1 to initiative and +20 to their strength. Magic Armor reduces the maneuver penalties associated with its armor type. This does not mean, however, that all magic items are paragons of beauty. The <em>Work xxx</em> spells allow an Alchemist to make sure an item is without physical flaws and perfectly balanced, but crafting skills are still necessary to dress the item up and make it look its best.</p>
<h5><a name="TC_9.1.3.0.4">9.1.3.0.4</a> Weight of Magical Items</h5>
<p>Magical items may be made at increased or decreased weight (up to the limits shown in <a href="#TC_7.0">Section 7.0</a>). Needless to say, most magic armor is made at the lightest weight possible. This is done during the creation process and does not add to the cost of the item. <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#TC_T-9.1">Table 9.1</a> shows the effects of superior design and being made at 85% weight, the lightest weight possible.</p>
<h5><a name="TC_9.1.3.0.5">9.1.3.0.5</a> Strength of Magical Weapons</h5>
<p>The material strength of magical weapons is computed by taking the average strength for the weapon, add in any strength bonus for the material that the item was made from, add (or subtract) the bonus for item weight (if applicable), add the bonus for being of superior construction, and multiply the result by 1.5.</p>
<pre><strong>Material Strength of Magical Weapons</strong> = 1.5 x 
[average strength for the weapon type+ material strength bonus+ weight modifier+ superior construction modifier]</pre>
<blockquote id="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Unless the item is fully enchanted, a weapon with wooden haft is -45 to its strength against edged weapons.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> John the Alchemist has just created a +15 magical broadsword from white alloy stock that is 90% weight. The strength of the item would be:

<h2><a name="TC_9.2">9.2</a> ITEMS WITH INTELLIGENCE</h2>
<p>A great many fantasies include the weird and sometimes terribly troublesome occurrence of a weapon, or some other item, with literally a mind of its own. This characteristic is most often associated with items of great power: swords that will never permit themselves to be used for evil purposes, swords which only commit evil acts, swords which rule a land, swords which slay a man's best friends, items such as rings of such great power and will that no one can resist them, stones of light for which nations will war for centuries, etc.</p>
<p>In such a context, it becomes obvious that self-willed items hold a critically important place in the world of fantasy, faerie, and imagination. The following is a suggested system for incorporating willed items into <em><strong>Rolemaster</strong></em>.</p>

<h3><a name="TC_9.2.1">9.2.1</a> DERIVING WILL</h3>
<p>Deriving will for characters is a slightly different process than deriving the will for items. This section shows how to derive will for both characters and for items.</p>
<h5><a name="TC_9.2.1.0.1">9.2.1.0.1</a> Will for Characters</h5>
<p>A character's will is determined by his five "will" stats (or more accurately, the stat bonuses for his will stats). The five will stats are: Reasoning, Self Discipline, Empathy, Intuition, and Presence. Add together the stat bonuses for these five stats and then multiply by three. This is the character's Will bonus. This bonus will add to all Will Contests (<a href="#TC_9.2.2">see below</a>).</p>
<h5><a name="TC_9.2.1.0.2">9.2.1.0.2</a> Will for Items</h5>
<p>To determine the will for items, you must first derive the item's will stats. Before using the table below, the GM must assign an intelligence level for the item (Empathic, Low Intelligence, Medium Intelligence, High Intelligence, Very High Intelligence, Artifact, or Legendary Artifact). If an intelligence level is not obvious, simply use Medium Intelligence. Roll d100 (open-ended) on the chart below (using the appropriate column for item' s intelligence level). Roll once for each of the five will stats. Add the five results together (do not triple) to determine the item's will.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/9.2.2/WILL CONTEST" -->
<h3><a name="TC_9.2.2">9.2.2</a> WILL CONTEST</h3>
<p>An item does not always communicate its will or direction in a clearly discernable form (e.g., by voice or telepathic contact). Instead, an item sometimes reveals its direction in the way in which it can slowly but dramatically alter the persona of the individual wielding the item. This assumes that the item is able to gain control of the individual, and that the intents of the item are different from those of the person.</p>
<p>Before a Will Contest can be resolved , a "control situation" must exist. A control situation is defined as anytime a character is touching an item and attempts to use the item in a way that is contrary to its purpose and/or alignment (sometimes this is simply wielding the item).</p>
<p>Whenever a control situation arises, a special RR should be made. Use the items level as the attack level and the character's level as the target level. However, the only other modifiers to this roll are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The target character's racial modifier (see chart below);</p></li>
<li><p>Any modifiers that result from previous Will Contests.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="TC_9.2.3">9.2.3</a> PURPOSE AND ALIGNMENT</h3>
<p>As it might be somewhat hazy as to what is meant by an item's purpose and an item's alignment, an explanation follows (with examples). The possibilities (especially of purposes) are nearly endless and the GM should feel free to create any additional ones he desires.</p>
<p>The <em>alignment</em> of an item (or anything else for that matter) is its moral disposition. Alignment is usually characterized by such terms as good and evil. Alignments can fall further into sub-categories such as virtuous, principled, honorable, strictly lawful, selfish, anarchist, amoral, aberrant, honorable miscreant, diabolical, etc.</p>
<p><em>Purposes</em> are specific tasks to be accomplished, principles to be upheld, or personal gains to be enjoyed. There are myriad purposes possible (perhaps an infinite number). Some examples follow, hopefully illustrating the breadth of possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Defending the helpless.</li>
<li>The cause of justice.</li>
<li>The cause of mercy.</li>
<li>Slaying the enemies of one's god.</li>
<li>Slaying the enemies of the evil one.</li>
<li> Ridding the world of evil spell casters.</li>
<li>Ridding the world of composite creatures.</li>
<li>Ridding the world of created entities.</li>
<li>Ridding the world of undead.</li>
<li>Ridding the world of dragons and dragonkin.</li>
<li>Ridding the world of orcs and their kin.</li>
<li>General mayhem; i.e., a hunger for bloodshed.</li>
<li>Upholding the Good Channeling users.</li>
<li>Self-aggrandizement (there are many types): Seeking a master with the highest level, Seeking a master with the greatest political power, the amassing of treasure, the seeking of magical secrets, a quest for magical items, becoming a Lord of evil.</li>
</ul>
<p>As it becomes clear, the possibilities are far to numerous to quantify. Each GM should examine his world and determine what types of alignments and/or purposes are appropriate.</p>

<p>When this sword directly strikes the enemy's armor or shield, the enemy's armor or shield must make a Resistance Roll against a 25<sup>th</sup> level attack or be destroyed. Remember than enchanted items make all RRs with the level as the target level. Non-magic items make RRs as if they were first level.</p>
<p>Shields must make the RR if a melee attack by this weapon is parried by part of the target's Shield Bonus; if such an attack would have struck the target without the Shield Bonus subtraction, the target's shield is struck and must make the RR. In addition, the shield must make an RR if the critical result designates that the shield arm was struck by the blow.</p>
<p>Armor must make the RR if the critical result specifies an area covered by the armor (if no area is specifically mentioned in the critical result, the armor must make an RR).</p>

<p>The weapon delivers holy criticals when used against "evil" (or of alignment opposite that of the weapon) Large and Super Large creatures (use the Holy Arms column). If this weapon delivers a critical against a man sized "evil" creature, that critical is resolved normally and then a second critical is resolved on the Holy Arms column of the Large Creature Critical Strike Table.</p>
<h5><a name="TC_9.3.3.0.14">9.3.3.0.14</a> Increased Critical</h5>
<p>Any primary criticals delivered by the weapon are increased one level in effect. Thus, An 'A' critical becomes a 'B,' a 'B' becomes a 'C,' etc. An 'E' critical becomes an 'F' criticals (which yields an 'E' result and an 'A' result on the same critical strike table). The weapon's attack must deliver a critical for this ability to function (i.e., an attack that delivers just concussion damage, does not deliver an 'A' critical). This ability has no effect on secondary criticals.</p>
<h5><a name="TC_9.3.3.0.15">9.3.3.0.15</a> Increased Potency</h5>
<p>A one-handed weapon may attack on the combat table of another similar one-handed weapon (defined as using the same weapon category). Thus, a dagger could attack as a short sword (or another one-handed edged attack table). A two-handed weapon may attack on the combat table of another two-handed weapon. Thus, a spear could attack as a lance. The alternate weapon type must be specified at the time of the item's creation. The weapon retains its own fumble, strength, breakage factors, and ranges.</p>
<h5><a name="TC_9.3.3.0.16">9.3.3.0.16</a> Weapon of Returning</h5>
<p>At the end of a round that it is thrown or fired, the weapon will return to the thrower's hand using <em>Long Door III</em>.

If no normal device is available, the item will appear at the feet of the person who fired the missile.</p>
<h5><a name="TC_9.3.3.0.17">9.3.3.0.17</a> Weapon Slayer</h5>
<p>When the weapon directly strikes an enemy's weapon, the enemy's weapon must make a breakage roll at -100 or be destroyed. This normally occurs if a melee attack by this sword is parried by part of the target's OB. Ifsuch an attack would have struck the target without the OB parry subtraction, the target's weapon is struck and must make the breakage roll. Weapons resist as if they were first level, unless they are enchanted (in which case they resist at their level).</p>

This effect cannot reduce one category of armor, such as Rigid Leather, to a lesser category, such as Soft Leather. The reduction is applied before the effects of superior construction or reduced weight are applied. If applied to a shield, the enchanted ability can reduce the weight of a Wall Shield to that of a Full Shield, a Full Shield to a Normal Shield, etc. In the case of a Target Shield, this ability will cut its weight by one quarter (i.e., 75% of normal weight).</p>

This effect cannot reduce one category of armor, such as Rigid Leather, to a lesser category, such as Soft Leather. The reduction is applied before the effects of superior construction or reduced weight are applied. If applied to a shield, the enchanted ability can reduce the weight of a Wall Shield to that of a Normal Shield, a Full Shield to a Target Shield, a Normal Shield to a three quarter weight Target Shield, and will cut the weight of a Target Shield by one half (i.e., 50% of normal weight).</p>
<h5><a name="TC_9.4.2.0.4">9.4.2.0.4</a> Normal Increased AT</h5>
<p>The protection for a suit of armor may be increased by two types. Thus, a suit of AT 9 could have the protection of a suit of AT 11. This effect cannot increase one category of armor, such as Rigid Leather, to a greater category, such as Chain. If applied to a shield, this will give a Target Shield the bonuses of a Full Shield, and a Normal Shield or a Full Shield those of a Wall Shield. It will not raise the bonuses of a Wall Shield.</p>

<h3><a name="TC_9.4.3">9.4.3</a> ARMOR IV EFFECTS</h3>
<h5><a name="TC_9.4.3.0.1">9.4.3.0.1</a> Greater Critical Reduction</h5>
<p>The armor reduces the level of criticals by two. Thus an 'E' critical becomes a 'C,' a 'D' becomes a 'B,' a 'C' becomes an 'A,' a 'B' becomes an 'A' with a special modifier of -20 to the critical roll, and an 'A' becomes an 'A' with a special modifier of -50 to the critical roll.</p>
<h5><a name="TC_9.4.3.0.2">9.4.3.0.2</a> Greater Critical Negation</h5>
<p>The armor has a 30% chance of negating a critical. This can only be applied to one specific location of a suit of armor such as a helm, breastplate, etc., though multiple abilities can be applied to the same suit of armor to cover different areas. This ability is not cumulative with other critical reductions that apply to the same area.</p>
<h5><a name="TC_9.4.3.0.3">9.4.3.0.3</a> Greater Decreased Maneuver Penalty</h5>
<p>The maneuver penalty for a suit of armor may be decreased by three types. Thus, a suit of AT 16 could have the maneuver penalties of a suit of AT 13. This effect cannot reduce one category ofarmor, such as Rigid Leather, to a lesser category, such as Soft Leather. The reduction is applied before the effects of superior construction or reduced weight are applied. If applied to a shield, the enchanted ability can reduce the weight of a Wall Shield to that of a Target Shield, a Full Shield to a three quarter weight Target Shield (i.e., 75% of the normal weight of a Target Shield), a Normal Shield to a half weight Target Shield (i.e., 50% of the normal weight of a Target Shield), and will cut the weight of a Target Shield by three quarters (i.e., 75% of the normal weight).</p>
<h5><a name="TC_9.4.3.0.4">9.4.3.0.4</a> Greater Increased AT</h5>
<p>The protection for a suit of armor may be increased by three types. Thus, a suit of AT 9 could have the protection of a suit of AT 12. This effect cannot increase one category of armor, such as Rigid Leather, to a greater category, such as Chain. Greater Increased AT will also allow crowns, circlets, etc., to protect as a helm. If applied to a shield, this will give a Target Shield, a Normal Shield, or a Full Shield the bonuses of a Wall Shield. It will not raise the bonuses of a Wall Shield.</p>

<h1><a name="TC_11.0">11.0</a> RESEARCH AND LORD RESEARCH</h1>
<p>There are two specific spells that can create a bit of confusion in the creation of items: <em>Research</em> and <em>Lord Research</em>. This section deals with these spells specifically.</p>
<h5><a name="TC_11.0.0.0.1">11.0.0.0.1</a> Research</h5>
<p>Normally, the spell to be imbedded in an object must be cast every day onto the object. This can be logistically difficult if the object takes very long to make and the creator of the object doesn't know the spell himself (as he must find someone to come and cast the spell everyday).</p>
<p>There is a way to get around this requirement. On two spell lists (Own Realm Imbedding and Other Realm Imbedding) the first level spell is called <em>Research</em>. The spell can be used to avoid logistical problems in imbedding spells into items. The spell to be imbed in the item must be cast once into the item; however, prior to the casting of the spell to be imbedded, the <em>Research</em> spell may be cast. The <em>Research</em> spell will record the magical patterns created by the next spell cast (so long as it is cast within one minute after the <em>Research</em> spell is cast). On every day thereafter, the <em>Research</em> spell can be cast in place of the spell to be imbedded. Note that the power needed to "re-cast" the <em>Research</em> spell is equal to one PP plus the level of the spell to be imbedded. A given caster can only have one spell "researched" at a time (he may choose to replace his researched spell at any time).</p>
<blockquote id="option"><strong>Option:</strong> Some GMs may decide that casting this spell will assist in spell research (as shown <a href="5522.html#SL_7.5">Section 7.5 of <em>Spell Law</em></a>). If used in this fashion, every time this spell is cast decrease the time needed to research anew spell by 1day; note that the total time cannot be decreased by more than half its original amount.</blockquote>
<h5><a name="TC_11.0.0.0.2">11.0.0.0.2</a> Lord Research</h5>
<p>The use of this spell has caused some controversy for GMs. The <em>Lord Research</em> spell has been provided to give GMs a tool for controlling magic item creation in his world. For example, in some worlds the GM may decide that items can only be created by having specific types of people working in a specific place with specific materials (and failure to have all things aligned results in 10 or 100 times the time needed to create items). The <em>Lord Research</em> spell could be used to discover exactly what is needed to pull this all together (this is most likely the way the magical rings of Middle-earth were created).</p>
<p>Another way to use this spell is to research special enchanted abilities that are not given in this book. GMs should be careful when allowing new enchanted abilities. It is better to make them cost more than is necessary than to make them cost to little.</p>
<p>In conculsion, the GM should use <em>Lord Research</em> as a tool to make magic items harder to create; or at least the only way that artifact-style magic items can be created.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/12.0/CREATING NEW MASTER MAGIC ITEM CHARTS" -->
<h1><a name="TC_12.0">12.0</a> CREATING NEW MASTER MAGIC ITEM CHARTS</h1>
<p>For some GMs, however, simply adding or subtracting from the rolls to generate treasure will not allow them to exactly simulate their world. This might happen because the Alchemists of a particular world might not make runes or potions. Attunement might be a restricted skill, which could mean that Alchemists produce more armor, general items, and weapons which do not require such rolls. There are many reasons why this might be the case.</p>
<p>This section is designed as a guide to modifying the Master Magic Item Chart. First, let us look at the assumptions that went into the tables presented in <em>Treasure Companion</em>. The tables referred to below can be found in <a href="#Part_III">Part III</a>.</p>
<p>The first assumption is that Alchemists can achieve, at most, 50<sup>th</sup> level in power. Consequently, the Master Item Table must go to 50<sup>th</sup> level. With this in mind, the general breakdown of the Master Magic Item Table is as follows: 50% of the items are from 1<sup>st</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> level (Apprenticeship level); 30% of the items are from 6<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> level (Journeyman level); 15% of the items are from 11<sup>th</sup> to 20<sup>th</sup> level (Master level); approximately 4% of the items are from 21<sup>st</sup> to 30<sup>th</sup> level (Guild Master Level); approximately 0.25% of the items are from 31<sup>st</sup> to 40<sup>th</sup> level; and around 0.000125% of the items found are from 41<sup>st</sup> to 50<sup>th</sup> level. Within these percentages, the item types (Armor, Charged, Daily/Constant, etc.) will be found in roughly equal numbers.</p>
<p>From looking at this table, you can see that it was designed for a world where there would be equal demand for all types of items, where items of up to Master class have a good chance of being found, and where there are Alchemists who are up to 50<sup>th</sup> level who are, or have been relatively recently, creating items. Of course, this set up will not work for all societies.</p>
<p>The example below shows the three quantities that must be identified to create a modified Master Magic Item table (for a different world set up). First, what is the highest level item that the GM wishes the players to be able to find? This is called the cut-off level. Anything beyond this level becomes an artifact and should not be found on the charts. Second, what is the level breakdown appropriate to the world. Perhaps in a particular world, apprentice magic should be 1-10<sup>th</sup> level rather than 1-5<sup>th</sup> level. Also, of the magics that are available, what percentage should be apprentice level as opposed to journeyman level, or master level. This is accomplished by first dividing up the range from 1 to 95 and then deciding how many open ends it will take to reach a particular magic level. To make life easier, the ranges from 96-195 shall be referred to as 1OE (one open ended roll), 196-295 as 2OE, etc. Finally, of the magics available, how do the types of magic break down? Does a world have more armor than weapons? Perhaps all Alchemists can create are runes and potions. By answering these questions, a GM can easily put a new Table together. The World Alchemical Data Chart has been provided to help make this process easier.</p>
<p>Now let us look at two different worlds as examples of this process. The first is a world in which Alchemists function as personal servants to nobles. The GM first decides that he does want to lower the maximum level of items that can be found. He sets the level at 40. Because there is not going to be any Guild Masters or Legendary Guild Masters, no percentages have to be allocated to those ideas, though he will divide up Legendary Masters into those that require 1OE and those that require 2OE. Because in his world Alchemists will go from apprenticeship straight to Mastery (no official journeyman period due to political considerations), no percentage needs to be given there either. He also decides that apprenticeship will cover all levels from 1<sup>st</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup>. After some thought he determines that most of the work is low level and actually done by apprentices, so he decides that 70% of the items found are apprentice level and that 25% are of Master Level.</p>
<p>Next, he turns his attention to the item types. Because most of the items will be created for nobles, who will probably not have a great deal of Attunement skill or be able to Read Runes, he decides that most items that get created will not actually require these sorts of rolls. He decides then, that Daily items will have to work with command words, and that Runes are not to be found at all. Of the items available, most are Daily and General items that make the nobles' lives easier. After some thought he comes up with the following results.</p>
<p>By multiplying the Level Breakdown Percentage by the Item Type percentage, the GM determines that Apprenticeship Armor (1<sup>st</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> level) should have a 7% chance of being found; Apprenticeship Charged Items have a 3.5% chance of being found (he decides to round down to three), etc. Some of these values will have to be divided over two entries such as the 7% chance of finding Apprenticeship Armor, which has to be divided between the Armor Table I and Armor Table II entries.. For the OE values, just use the Item Type percentage for each type (each OE represents a 1 to 100 range, after all). After some math, the GM arrives at the following table.</p>
<p>Notice that there is no entry for Potion Table V. In this case the GM took the 15% that would have applied to Potions out of the 2OE range, and added 10 of it to the chance of finding a Legendary Master Daily Item and the remaining 5 to the chance of finding a Legendary Master General Items.</p>
<p>In the next example, the GM looks at his world and decides that his Alchemists should be very low powered. He decides that the cut-off level is 20 and that most of the items are below 10<sup>th</sup> level. He also looks at the Item Types and decides that more Armor, Weapons, and Potions will be found (there are lots of adventuring fighters and thieves, but few spell users, who will be his Alchemists' main clients). Based upon these assumptions, he comes up with the following World Alchemy Data Table.</p>
<p>Based on these numbers he generates the following Master Magic Item table.</p>
<p>By means ofthis method, a GM can create Master Magic Item Charts for the regions and countries as well as the entire world.</p>

<h1><a name="TC_13.0">13.0</a> ALCHEMY SPELL LISTS</h1>
<p>This section lists all of the spells associated with the Arcane realm. All of the standard rules, restrictions, and notations from <em>Spell Law</em> are used here. For convenience, the spell description key is repeated here.</p><h4>THE SPELL DESCRIPTION KEY</h4>
<p>Several types ofcodes may follow the spell names in the listings: area of effect, duration, range, and type. In addition, some descriptions will explain that a particular spell has an RR Modification (shown with the notation <tt>[RR Mod: #]</tt>). This section presents a key to those codes.</p>
<h4>SPECIAL SPELL CODES</h4>
<p><tt>[RR Mod #]</tt> - Any RRs against the effects of this spell are modified by #.</p>
<p><strong><sup>&#42;</sup></strong> &mdash; Instantaneous; spell does not require preparation rounds.</p>
<p><strong><sup>&bull;</sup></strong> &mdash; Spell does not require power points.</p>
<p><strong><sup>&Dagger;</sup></strong> &mdash; Part of a set of spells that must be thrown in conjunction with other spells continuously to be effective (or fully effective).</p>
<h4>SPELL TYPES</h4>
<p><strong>E</strong> &mdash; Elemental spell. These spells use the force of the spell to manipulate physical elements (heat, cold, wind, light, water, earth, sound, smell, taste, touch). These elements (and not the spell) are used to either create a phenomena that can affect the physical environment of the target (e.g., a "wall" spell) or the sense of the target (e.g., an "illusion" spell). Because the elements are real, no Resistance Rolls are normally allowed.</p>
<p><strong>BE</strong> &mdash; Ball Elemental spell. These are elemental spells that attack an area with one of the physical elements.</p>
<p><strong>DE</strong> &mdash; Directed Elemental spell. These are elemental spells that directly attack a target with one of the physical elements. Such attacks are resolved on one of the "bolt" attack tables.</p>
<p><strong>F</strong> &mdesh; Force spell. These spells involve the direct manipulation of matter, energy, the elements, or living beings through the use of a spell's force. If the spell has a target capable ofresisting, the caster make an attack roll on the <em>Spell Law</em> <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_T-5.1">Basic Spell Attack Table 5.1</a> to determine the RR modification for the target. Determine the type of armor the target is wearing and roll on the appropriate column of the table (using the Other column if nothing else applies). After determining the RR modification, the target makes an RR (on <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SL_5.10">Table 5.10</a> in <em>Spell Law</em>, using the target's level and the attacker's level as the indices).</p>
<p><strong>P</strong> &mdash; Passive spell. These spells usually only indirectly or passively affect a target. Thus, if an RR is allowed (GM' s discretion), its purpose is only to determine if the target is aware of the spell. Many detection spells are of this type.</p>
<p><strong>U</strong> &mdash; Utility spell. These spells only affect the caster, a willing target, or a target incapable of resistance. Thus, RRs are not usually necessary. A willing target who is capable of resisting may still be required to make an RR (GM's discretion), but it is modified by -50 (i.e., he mostly likely will not resist successful). Most healing spells are of this type.</p>
<p><strong>I</strong> &mdash; Infomlational spell. These spells involve gathering information through means that do not require RRs.</p>
<h4>SPELL SUB-TYPES</h4>
<p><strong>s</strong> &mdesh; Subconscious spell. These spells are capable of being cast (or triggered) by the subconscious. The caster can always cast a spell of this type as a normal spell; and ifhe is unconscious (or is asleep or in a trance), a spell of this type can be cast by the subconscious as necessary (starting with the highest level spell needed). An exception to this is the <em>Stun Relief</em> spell. This spell may (at the option of the caster) be cast by the subconscious while the caster is stunned.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong> &mdash; Mental Attack spell. These spells affect the target's mind and are subject to mental defenses.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong> &mdash; Vestment spell. These spells require the caster to be wearing a magical vestment.</p>
<h4>SPELL AREAS OF EFFECT</h4>
<p><strong><em>x</em> target(s)</strong> &mdash; The spell affects <em>x</em> number of targets.</p>
<p><strong><em>x</em> target(s)/lvl</strong> &mdash; The spell affects a number of targets equal to the caster's level times <em>x</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em>distance</em> R</strong> &mdash; The spell affects all within a radius equal to <em>distance</em> in size.</p>
<p><strong><em>distance</em> R/lvl</strong> &mdash; The spell affects all within a radius equal to <em>distance</em> times the caster's level in size.</p>
<p><strong><em>area</em></strong> &mdash; The spell affects all within a fixed <em>area</em> of effect. Sometimes area will be specified as a specific target (e.g., 1 herb, 1 limb, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>caster</strong> &mdash; The spell affects only the caster.</p>
<p><strong>" &mdash; "</strong> &mdash; The spell has no area of effect.</p>
<p><strong>varies</strong> &mdash; The exact size of the area of effect depends upon some other aspect of the spell.</p>
<h4>SPELL DURATIONS</h4>
<p><strong><em>time</em></strong> &mdash; The spell has a fixed duration equal to time.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> &mdash; Concentration is required. Concentration takes 50% of the caster's normal activity. The caster cannot cast any other spells while concentrating.</p>
<p><strong><em>duration</em> (C)</strong> &mdash; Concentration is required, except the period ofconcentration cannot exceed the duration given. The caster can stop concentrating and the spell effect will stop. If the duration has not expired, the caster can concentrate again and the spell effect will resume.</p>
<p><strong>P</strong> &mdash; Permanent. The spell has a permanent effect (in the sense of creating a "permanent" physical or mental condition). The effects of permanent spells that manipulate matter <strong>and</strong> require concentration will disperse according to the normal physical laws once concentration is no longer applied (e.g., a frozen body of water will melt normally, a bowl of boiling water will cool). A spell with a permanent duration may be affect by outside forces. For example, the spell may be dispelled, cured, or otherwise disturbed by enchantment, physical force, etc.</p>
<p><strong>varies</strong> &mdash; Variable. The exact duration depends upon some other aspect of the spell.</p>
<p><strong>" &mdash; "</strong> &mdash; No duration. The effects of this spell required no duration and are applied immediately.</p>
<p><strong><em>time</em> / level</strong> &mdash; The duration is the time multiplied by the level of the caster.</p>
<p><strong><em>time</em> / <em>#</em> fail</strong> &mdash; The duration is based upon the difference between the target's modified RR and the minimum roll required to resist the spell (see <em>RMSR</em> <a href="5500.html#RMSR_23.6">Section 23.6</a>). The duration is equal to this difference divided by <em>#</em> and then multiplied by <em>time</em>.</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> 1 rnd/10 fail would mean that ifthe RR is failed by 20, the spell would lastfor 2 rounds.</blockquote>
<h4>SPELL RANGES</h4>
<p><strong>self</strong> &mdash; The spell can only be cast upon the caster himself</p><p><strong>touch</strong> &mdash; The caster must touch the target to create the effect.</p>
<p><strong><em>distance</em></strong> &mdash; The caster can be no further than <em>distance</em> to the desired area of effect.</p>
<p><strong><em>distance</em>/lvl</strong> &mdash; The distance to the area of effect can be no further than distance times the caster's level.</p>
<p><strong>unlimited</strong> &mdash; There are no limitations placed upon the distance to the area of effect.</p>
<p><strong>varies</strong> &mdash; The distance to the are of effect depends upon some other aspect of the spell.</p>
<h4>WHAT'S ON A SPELL LIST</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Spell List Name</strong> &mdash; The name of the spell list appears in two places on the page; above the descriptions and above the listing.</li>
<li><strong>Spell List Number</strong> &mdash; Each spell list is given a unique identifier that combines its classification and a the equivalent of a section number from <em>Spell Law</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Listing</strong> &mdash; In one of the upper corners of the page is a listing ofall the spells on the list, sorted by level. This listing also shows important spell parameters.</li>
<li><strong>Check Box</strong> &mdash; Beside each spell in the listing is a check box. Use this box to indicate the level two which your character currently knows spells on the list.</li>
<li><strong>Spell Level/Name</strong> &mdash; The level and name of each spell appears in two places on the page; in the listing and in the descriptions. In all cases, if the name of two spells are the same (except for perhaps a roman numeral), the spells should be treated as the same.</li>
<li><strong>Area of Effect</strong> &mdash; This is the area affected by the spell. If "varies" appears here, check the description for the exact area of effect.</li>
<li><strong>Duration</strong> &mdash; This is the duration that the spell will remain active. If "varies" appears here, check the description for the exact duration.</li>
<li><strong>Range</strong> &mdash; This is the range from the caster to the area of effect. If "varies" appears here, check the description for the exact range.</li>
<li><strong>Type</strong>&mdash; This is the type of spell. The type of spell will determine what kind of resistance roll the target of the spell will get (if any).</li>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/14.0/TREASURE GENERATION" -->
<h1><a name="TC_14.0">14.0</a> TREASURE GENERATION</h1>
<p>Ideally, a GM should always carefully consider what treasure he hands out to his party. He should make sure that it is part of the theme and scope that he is trying to achieve. If he wants them to be poor and straining to survive, he should give out little treasure and perhaps few items. Ifhis game is very magic intense, perhaps magical items should be found in every hoard. The wealth the party accumulates should be entirely in keeping with the story, and OMs can (and have) spend hours trying to decide exactly what to give to their players in an effort to make it a vital part of storytelling.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, ofcourse, most GMs do not always have time to do this. To make things easier, the following system has been provided to allow GMs to quickly generate random treasures. The rules presented here should be seen as a guideline (and ignored entirely whenever the GM feels it appropriate). As a GM works through the following tables, he should keep in mind his themes and campaign tone. If a result arises that he does not like, it should be discarded. When this happens, the GM should either make another roll or simply decide on a result that will suit his purposes.</p><p>Keep in mind that certain steps in this process are purely optional. If a GM does not desire to go into great detail about what types of gems his players find, then the Precious Gem and Semi-precious Gem Charts should be skipped. Likewise, if a GM feels he needs to award a particular character with a new suit ofarmor, he should simply decide that it is in the hoard. These charts are a tool to facilitate awards, not a tool to restrict awards</p>
<h4><a name="TC_14.0.0.1">14.0.0.1</a> PROCEDURE</h4>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Determine what the Treasure Code is for the particular monster</strong> &mdash; Creatures and Monsters gives a set of codes (a through z) that determine what sorts of hoards (collections of treasure) a monster has. Hoards are made up of two components; an item component and a wealth component. These components are rated from Very Poor to Very Rich. <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#TC_T-14.1">Table (T-14.1)</a> provides a key to the treasure codes found in <a href="5540.html"><em>C&amp;M</em></a>.</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> The players are going toface a War Troll. and the GM wants to figure out what it has with it. The troll's treasure type is t, which gives an item treasure rating of Rich, and a wealth treasure rating of Very Rich.</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Determine Hoard Component rolls</strong> &mdash; Once a GM has the treasure code, he will need to make two rolls (d100, not open-ended). The first is on the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#TC_T-14.2">Item Component Table (T-14.2)</a>. The second is on the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#TC_14.3">Wealth Component Table (T-14.3)</a>. Then cross index them with the wealth rating for each. These rolls will indicate how many subsequent rolls are to be made on the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#TC_T-14.4">Item Table (T-14.4)</a> and the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#TC_T-14.6">Wealth Table (T-14.6)</a>.</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> In determining the treasure for the aforementioned War Troll, the GM first rolls an 84 on the item Component Table. Indexing this with the item treasure rating ofRich yields three items. Next he rolls a 45 on the Wealth Component Table, so he will have to make two rolls on the Wealth Table.</blockquote>
<p>If a creature has more than one letter in its treasure code, a separate Hoard Component roll is made for each letter.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Determine Items</strong> &mdash; First, the GM should roll (d100, not open-ended) on the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#TC_14.4">Item Table (T-14.4)</a> a number of times that was indicated in Step 2 (these rolls are also indexed by the wealth rating that the treasure code indicated). For each result of a general item, armor, shield, herb, or weapon, the GM should roll on the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#TC_T-14.5">Normal Item Table (T-14.5)</a> to determine what the bonus of the normal item is. For each roll if a general item, armor, shield, herb, or weapon is indicated, the GM should roll on the appropriate table (<a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#TC_T-14.11">T-14.11</a> through <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#T-14.14">T-14.14</a>) to determine its exact nature of the item.</p>
<p>If a roll on the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#TC_T-14.14">Item Table (14.14)</a> indicates a magical item, the GM should roll (d100, not open-ended) on the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#TC_T-14.16">Master Magic Item Table (T-14.16)</a>. The result will indicate what Table the GM must roll on next to determine the specific magical item found. Note, not all entries on the magical item charts specify the exact form of the item, though they will indicate what category (metal armor, wooden weapons, etc.) that the item belongs in. If the specific form of the item is not indicated, the GM can determine what the specific item is by rolling on the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#TC_T-14.5">Normal Item Table (T-14.5)</a>.</p>
<p>If an item specifies an Enchanted Ability, the GM should roll on the chart found at the bottom of that table Unless specified, the exact effects of General Items are left up to the GM to determine (For example, if the roll indicates a +5 General Item, and the Random General Item Table indicates a cloak, the player has found a +5 Cloak. The GM still has to determine what the exact effects are (e.g., it could be +5 to RRs vs Cold, +5 to Hiding manuevers, etc.)</p>
<p>Certain items (e.g., potions, runes, etc.) will specify that they have a certain level of spell imbedded in them. GMs should roll on the Master Spell List Table (T-14.15) to determine what list that spell is on. First roll d100 (not open-ended) to see what realm the spell is from (there are two possible rows to index on; one if the GM is using <span id="arcane">Arcane</span> magic in his game, one if he is not).</p>
<blockquote id="example"><p><strong>Example:</strong> Having determined that the war troll has three items the GM rolls three times on the Item table. His rolls are a 47, a 72, and a 94. Indexing these with the Rich column shows that the troll had a metal and wood weapon, an herb, and a magical  item. The GM next rolls a 57 on the Normal Item Bonus table, which, when indexed with the Rich column indicates that the item is 115% weight. Next the GM rolls a 65 on the Metal and Wooden Weapons table, which shows that the troll's 115% weight weapon is a morningstar. Then he rolls a 34 on the Herb and Poison table. The troll also has one dose of Aloe on him.</p>
<p>Finally, the GM determines what magical item the troll has with him. He first rolls a 53 on the Master Magical Items table and indicates that the troll has a suit of 6th to 10th level armor. Next he roll s a 77 on the 6th to 10th Level Armor table and yields a +I0 suit ofmetal armor with one enchanted ability. The enchanted ability is determined on the 9th Level Enchanted Ability table. Here the GM rolls a 33, Minor Critical Negation. Finally, the GM rolls on the Random Armor Table (since the result ofhis roll on the 6th to 10th Level Armor Table did not specify an armor type) here is rolls a 71, A T 20. So the troll possess a suit of +10 AT 20 armor with Minor Critical Negation. Assuming that the troll can wear it, his going to be very tough to face.</p></blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Determine Wealth</strong> &mdash; The GM should now roll a number of times on the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#TC_T-14.6">Wealth Table (T-14.6)</a> as was indicated in Step 2. These rolls are also indexed to the wealth rating specified Step 1.</p>
<p>If the GM desires, the exact composition and weight of gem and jewelry results can be determined by first rolling on their respective charts. On the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#TC_T-14.7">Gem Table (T-14.7</a> and <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#TC_T-14.8">T-14.8</a>), the roll will determine what type of gem the player has found. By dividing this the value of the gem from the Wealth table by the cost per carat of the gem type, the GM can determine how many total carats of gems there are. The weight of a carat is 0.2 grams (or .007 ounces). Use the table in Part I (<a href="#TC_2.0">Section 2</a>) as a guide to determine how many gems there should be.</p>
<p>In the case of jewelry, the GM should roll on the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#TC_T-14.9">Jewelry Composition Table (T-14.9)</a> and index the result with the wealth rating (from Step 1). This will determine how much of the value of the item is in precious metals and how much is in gems. Roll to determine what type of gems are in the piece of jewelry, and then rolll on the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#TC_14.10">Jewelry Table (T-14.10)</a> to see what type of jewelry it is.</p>
<p>To determine the actual weight of the piece of jewelry, first divide the value as determined by the Wealth Table (T-14.6) in half. This is the value of the material components. The weight of whatever percentage is made of metal can then determined by first multiplying the value of the material components by the percentage of metal and then dividing by 64 (this is the number of coins in a pound). For example, a piece of jewelry is determined to be a golden crown. The value of the jewelry is 100 gold pieces. Its material value is 50 gold pieces. Since it is 100% gold, all that the GM needs do is divide 50 by 64 which gives a resulting weight of 12 and 1/2 ounces.</p>
<blockquote id="example"><p><strong>Example:</strong> The GM now figures out how much cash the troll is carrying. He rolls twice on the Wealth table and indexes each roll with the Very Rich column. his first roll is a 71, equaling 150 gold pieces. His next roll is a 62, a 100 sp semi-precious gem. Since the GM wants to be able to tell his players what type o fgem it is, he rolls on the Semi-Precious Gem table. Here he must make two rolls since there are a lot of semi-precious gem varieties and they have been divided into 4 groups. He first rolls a 72 which tells him which of the 4 groups to roll in. He next rolls a 55, which indicates that the troll has a piece ofSagenite. The Sagenite is worth 3.4 bp per caret, so he divides the 100 sp value by .34 (the silver value per caret) which means that he has a 294 caret gem. Thus, this gem weighs 58 grams or 2.58 ounces.</p></blockquote></li>
</ol>
<h4><a name="TC_14.0.0.2">14.0.0.2</a> THINGS TO CONSIDER</h4>
<p>The GM should look over the charts carefully before using them. The first thing that he should look at is the value of the money found on the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#TC_T-14.4">Wealth Table (T-14.6)</a>. The table was constructed assuming a silver standard. If a GM is using a gold standard in his campaign he should consider multiplying all values found on the Table by 10. GMs might also consider that some countries in his world might be wealthier than others. If this is the case, folks that frequent the wealthier countries may have more money than their cousins in poorer areas. GMs may wish to modify rolls on the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#TC_T-14.6">Wealth Table (T-14.6)</a> to represent regional availability of wealth.</p>
<p>With regard to items, the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#T-14.4">Item Table (T-14.4)</a> is set up to give a larger number of general items to magical ones. In certain worlds, the ratios this table establishes may be generate too few magical items, where as in other worlds it may produce too many magical items. GMs who are running a highly magical world may simply want to assume that the number of items from the Item Component table is the number of magical items, not the number of magical and non-magical items. GMs with very little magic in their worlds may wish to add a modifier of -1 0 or -20 to their rolls on the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#T-14.4">Item Table (T-14.4)</a> to reflect the fact that their world is magically impoverished.</p>
<p>Another area of concern for some GMs may be the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#TC_14.16">Master Magical Item Table (T-14.16)</a>. It assumes there are, or at least have been in the recent past, Alchemists capable of producing up to 50th level items. Though the odds of finding any in any particular hoard are very small (approximately 1 in 125 million), some GMs may feel that there are no Alchemists who can or who could have created such items. GMs may wish to cut off just how high the rolls can get (i.e., 20th or 30th level), and/or assign a negative modifier to all rolls on the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#TC_14.15">Master Magical Item Table (T-14.16)</a>. This last idea will also greatly increase the number of low level items generated. If neither of these considerations quite works for a particular GM, he may wish to look at <a href="#TC_12.0">Section 12.0</a> for more information on how to customize these tables to fit in a given world.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="RMSS/5601/15.0/KEYING" -->
<h1><a name="TC_15.0">15.0</a> KEYING</h1>
<p>Items may be keyed to limit their effects in certain ways. Thus, Alchemists can produce items that will only work for a certain type of client, not be usable by a group of beings, or against a certain type of being. The charts presented here represent a small fraction of the available keys. GMs are encouraged to think up their own keys and introduce them as they see fit.</p>
<p>A word of caution before using these Charts; though keys can produce a great deal of flavor, they do have a serious drawback. Keys limit who can use an item. Consequently, adventurers may get their hands on items they Roll cannot use. This will encourage them to seek out others who are able to use such items. In worlds were GMs do not want to see much trade in magical items, using keys on items can be counter-productive.</p>
<p>To use the charts,</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Roll on the Number of Keys Chart (d100, not open-ended).Thiswillgeneratethenumberofkeys,ifany,that the item is set for.</p></li>
<li><p>Roll each key on the Key Type Chart (d100, not open-ended). This will let a GM know if the key is Positive, Negative, or Adversarial. Positive Keys will only work in a particular circumstance (e.g., an item can be keyed to only work for elves). Negative Keys are keys that will not work in a particular circumstance (e.g., an item can be keyed not to work in daylight). Adversarial Keys are keys that only work against a particular circumstance (e.g., working against creatures of darkness).</p></li>
<li><p>Each key should be rolled (dlOO, open-ended) or selected from the Key Chart. GMs should feel free to disregard any results that are inappropriate (i.e., if a world has no evil spell users, items keyed to this group should be re-rolled; if an item is keyed to only work against noon should be put aside, etc.). GMs should also note that the keys found at values above 95 get very specific. If more general keys are desired these results should be ignored.</p></li>

<h1><a name="TC_17.0">17.0</a> DIVINE MAGIC</h1>
<p>In most fantasy campaigns, there are gods. These beings of myth and legend may have a variety of origins. They may have been born in the fiery furnace of creation. Perhaps they were mortals who gained great magical knowledge. They may be embodiments of the forces of nature. The stories used to explain the birth and power of these great beings are many and varied.</p>
<p>What will be defined here is how the god's powers function in terms of the <em>RMSS</em>. This is necessary to address the subject of Alchemy as it relates to the works of divine beings. If this explanation does not completely mesh with the GM's perception of his world, he should feel free to modify it until it does mesh with the world.</p>
<p>The gods can be thought of, first off, as incredibly powerful <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Mentalist">Mentalists</a>. The gods, through years of practice or special ability, manipulate their own internal <span id="essence">Essence</span>. This <span id="essence">Essence</span> is then directed outward by the mind of the deity to affect the physical world. This is called a miracle.</p>
<p>The difference, of course, between a deity and even the most powerful of <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Mentalist">Mentalists</a> is far more than just a matter of degree, at least in many worlds. However, the effects (at the base level) both function in the same manner. A god just has far more power to play with, and is generally much higher in level than a mortal <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Mentalist">Mentalist</a> could ever attain.</p><p>At some point in the history of the universe, a relationship between deities and mortals arose. The exact time that this happens may vary from world to world. In some worlds, where the gods created the mortal races, it began as soon as we were created. In other worlds, where gods came along later than mortals or existed separately from them for some period of time, individuals entered into a bargain with the deity at some point in man's history.</p>
<p>This relationship is called worship. For whatever reason, perhaps protection, obligation, greed, or simply because people felt alone in the universe, beings agreed to worship the gods and make sacrifices to them. As part of this worship, small amounts of the worshipers' <span id="essence">Essence</span> would be given to the deity through the prayers and sacrifices that occur as part of the deity's religion. This fact, that worshipers are giving power to their deities through their faith, is probably not generally known to the common folk of most world and may not even be known to the deity's priests.</p>
<p>In return, the gods offered protection, power, and often great social cohesion for their worshippers. After all, everyone who worshipped the same deity could be counted, at least at initially, as a friend and potential ally against those who did not worship the deity. This relationship created the realm of <span id="channeling">Channeling</span>. As part of the bargain, the gods would dole out significant parts of their immense power and channel it to special worshipers called priests.</p>
<blockquote id="note"><strong>Note:</strong> <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Priest">Priest</a> in this sense refers to any <span id="channeling">Channeling</span> user, including <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Cleric">Clerics</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Paladin">Paladins</a>, <a href="../en.proj/professions.html#Ranger">Rangers</a>, etc.</blockquote>
<p>These priests could use this power in a variety of ways, though they are far more limited with what they can do with it than the deity would be. In return, the priests would spread the word of the deity's power, gain new worshipers, and maintain the faith of the old ones. This expands and maintains the power coming to the deity, which gives him more power to give to priests, which gives him more worshipers, etc.</p>

<h2><a name="TC_17.1">17.1</a> DIVINE ALCHEMY</h2>
<p>For those GMs who desire it, specific spell lists have been provided for Divine Alchemy. Divine Alchemy is the creation of items beyond the capability of mortals. Unlike mortal Alchemists, deities only need 5 spell lists to produce items. The lists are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Divine Enchantments:</strong> Enchanting items.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Divine Imbedding:</strong> Imbedding spells in items.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Divine Potions:</strong> Imbedding spells in potions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Divine Inorganics:</strong> Same as the General Alchemist Base List, Inorganic Skills.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Divine Organics:</strong> Same as the <a gref="../en.lproj/professions.html#Essence-based_Alchemist">Essence-based Alchemist</a> Base List, Organic Skills.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Though gods are subject to the same time constraints that mortals are (unless the GM deems otherwise), they do not generally have to pay the material cost, nordo they need to have raw materials on hand in order to create items (alternately, a GM might rule that deities do have to have such materials, but that acquiring them is generally not a problem). The new lists are given in <a href="#TC_17.3">Section 17.3</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="TC_17.2">17.2</a> CREATION OF DIVINE ITEMS</h2>
<p>Divine items can appear in a variety of ways besides being a result of a god directly creating them. Gods are generally depicted as rather busy people. A GM may well decide that the gods are simply too busy to spend all day, every day, for years to actually create divine items. Some gods (e.g., gods of the forge and creation), might take the time, but most probably will not. Does this mean that there probably no divine items running around? Far from it.</p>
<p>Due to their relationship with worshipers, deities have an option to channel spells to their priests. A deity could easily commune with one of his priests, tell him to get to work on a particular item that the deity needs or that he feels that his worshipers will need, and then Channel the spells necessary for the creation of said item to them (though a deity may well want to protect his worshipers from the effects of channeling burnout). This way the deity does not need to spend all the time necessary to create the item. The deity can even channel the same spells to several priests and have them do the work together, thus cutting down the amount of time necessary to create the item.</p>
<p>Alternately, a particular mage might well try and gain contact with the deity, or other powerful being such as a demon lord, and make a bargain. Such bargains are made by the mage promising a certain service (build a temple, kill a certain servant of a rival deity, sacrifice so many souls, etc.). For the deity's part, he gives the ability to create the item to the mage, normally by channeling him the spells necessary for the item's creation.</p>
<blockquote id="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If a GM does not wish to allow <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Channeling-based_Alchemist">Channeling-based Alchemists</a> in his campaign, this is an excellent way for those races that are not good <span id="essence">Essence</span> users, such as <a href="../en.lproj/races.html#Dwarves">Dwarves</a>, to still be noted for item creation.</blockquote>
