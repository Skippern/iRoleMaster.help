<h1><a name="SoHK_1.0">1.0</a> Introduction</h1>
<p>Thank you for purchasing the <em>Skill Companion</em>. This book is designed to be used by Gamemasters (<dfn>GMs</dfn>) and players to more precisely define the capabilities of the characters in their fantasy settings.<br />This book contains detailed rules and tables for all of the skills originally listed in <em>Rolemaster Fantasy Role Playing (RMFRP)</em> and <em>Character Law</em>. In addition, there are new options for skill development, skill resolution, and healing. Each skill category and individual skill is dissected in detail. Numerous examples are provided, especially for all non-combat skills.<br />The Skill Companion also contains material that focuses on characters who do not use spells. It provides 4 new professions, 18 new training packages, and optional GM material for balancing magic use.<br />This book does not examine combat skills or spells in any detail. These skills have been adequately dealt with in <em>Arms Law</em> and <em>Spell Law</em>. Additional details can be found in <em>Martial Arts Companion</em>, <em>Arcane Companion</em>, <em>Channeling Companion</em>, <em>Essence Companion</em>, and the <em>Mentalism Companion</em>.</p>
<h4><a name="SoHK_1.0.0.1">1.0.1</a> USING THIS BOOK WITH OTHER ROLEMASTER BOOKS</h4>
<p>When using this book with <em>RMFRP</em>, <em>Character Law</em>, <em>Arms Law</em>, and <em>Spell Law</em>, any information presented herein takes precedence. This book corrects a handful of minor misprints or oversights from <em>RMFRP</em> and <em>Character Law</em>. There is very little material that relates to <em>Spell Law</em> or <em>Arms Law</em>.<br />Any information contained within any other Companion takes precedence over the rules in this book. This reference material was designed (as much as possible) as a stand alone product. As a result, there are some discrepancies between this Companion and others. In such cases, the rules provided by the other Companions offer a more detailed analysis of a particular skill. For example, <em>Essence Companion</em> deals with <a name="../en.lproj/skills.html#Magical_Riturals">Magical Rituals</a> more intensively than is possible in this book.<br />Other source books (especially <em>Castles & Ruins</em>, <em>Gamemaster Law</em>, and <em>Creatures & Monsters</em>) are of great benefit, but not required to use this book. The information contained herein should not conflict with any information in those books. If discrepancies do arise in later source books, consider the specific source book to have the most applicable rules.</p>
<h4><a name="SoHK_1.0.0.2">1.0.2</a> NOTATION CONVENTIONS</h4><p>This book uses the standard notation found in <em>RMFRP</em> and <em>Character Law</em>. Whenever a stat is referenced (e.g., Strength), it refers to the stat bonus, unless otherwise indicated. In addition, for readability purposes, the standard masculine pronouns have been used when referring to persons of uncertain gender. In such cases, these pronouns are intended to convey the meanings: he/she, her/his, etc.</p>
<h4><a name="SoHK_1.0.0.3">1.0.3</a> LEVELS Of PLAY</h4><p>Every GM prefers his own style of play. This book attempts to accommodate this as much as possible. The GM should, however, decide on the power level of his campaign.<br />The goal of a mundane campaign is realism. The actions performed by the players are not heroic, but plausible. The character's immediate goals are small and manageable.<br />Most fantasy campaigns are heroic in nature. The characters are capable of performing feats not possible by mere mortals. The character's goals are grand; magic is a common occurance.<br />The focus of an epic campaign is immense. The players play characters whose actions move and shake the universe. The differences between good and evil are clear; the good guys usually win.<br />The penalties associated with performing maneuvers of various difficulties are presented below.</p>
<h4><a name="SoHK_1.0.0.4">1.0.4</a> DIFFICULTY LEVELS</h4><p>The difficulty level of a maneuver determines the penalty assigned to the maneuver roll. Throughout this book difficulty levels are also used for many other purposes. As a result, each difficulty has been assigned a numeric value, ranging from 1 to 9.<br />The first modifier applies to Static Maneuvers; the latter, to Moving Maneuvers. The Moving Maneuver modifiers are smaller since the difficulty of the maneuver is accounted for by the column on which the maneuver is resolved.</p>

<h1><a name="SoHK_2.0">2.0</a> Skill Resolution</h1>
<p>In many cases, a single skill or person is insufficient to complete a task. In these cases, the following guidelines can be used by the Gamemaster (GM) to facilitate sequential or simultaneous skill resolution.</p>
<h2><a name="SoHK_2.1">2.1</a> SPECIALIZED STATIC MANEUVER TABLES</h2><p><em>RMFRP</em> provides one generalized static maneuver table (<a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SoHK_T-4.3">T-4.3</a>). The <em>Skill Companion</em> provides a number of optional static maneuver tables, each keyed to a specific skill category. These specialized static maneuver tables are collected in <a href="#SoHK_7.0">Section 7.0</a>.<br />Each of these specialized static maneuver tables has two additional parameters for each result: a "time multiplier" and a special modifier for subsequent related maneuvers. The <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SoHK_T-4.3">General Static Maneuver Table T-4.3</a> provided on the next page is identical to <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#RMFRP+T-4.3">Static Maneuver Table T-4.3</a> in <em>RMFRP</em> except for the inclusion of these two new parameters.<br />General modifiers common to all skills within the category may be found near the bottom of each static maneuver table, while modifiers specific to each skill may be found with the definition of that skill. On many static maneuver tables there is room for the GM to write down his own general modifiers.<br />Occasions will arise where a specialized static maneuver table for a skill category may not produce appropriate results for a particular application of a skill. In this circumstance, the GM should modify the results to his liking, or use the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SoHK_T-7.1">General Static Maneuver Table T-7.1</a> (or <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#SoHK_T-4.3">T-4.3</a>).</p><h4><a name="SoHK_2.1.0.1">2.1.0.1</a> KEY TO THE STATIC MANEUVER TABLES</h4><p>If the initial unmodified roll is 66 or 100, the special optional entries for those values may be used instead of the modified result. The GM should examine these results carefully to appraise their suitability to his game; they have been highlighted to facilitate their exclusion if necessary.<br />Note that any modifier specified in the text of a result is not cumulative (i.e., an individual can only have one such modifier in effect at a given time for a particular skill).<br />Each result has a code associated with it:</p>
<pre>##% • #.#~ • ##"" 
</pre>
<p><strong>## %</strong> This indicates the extent to which a maneuver was successful. If partial or extra success is inappropriate, the GM should simply take 100% or higher as success and anything lower as failure.</p>
<p><strong>## ~</strong> This indicates a multiplier to the amount of time the task would ordinarily take to accomplish. The GM should determine how long a "standard" successful maneuver would take, and may, at his discretion, apply this multiplier to that time to determine the speed with which a character accomplished a task.</p><p><strong>## ""</strong> This gives a modifier to a subsequent related action on the part of a character. Note that this modifier may only be applied to an activity that is both immediate and integrally related to the maneuver that yielded this result. For example, a mage makes a static maneuver using his Research skill to study the teachings of a famous mathemetician, and receives a Subsequent Action modifier of +30. He then makes an Advanced Math static maneuver to utilize those teachings to solve a complex problem. He may add the +30 modifier to his Advanced Math static maneuver roll. This modifier is cumulative with any modifier specified in the text of the result.</p><blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> The GM may determine that this modifier is innapropriate to a particular subsequent action, whereupon it should be ignored.
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="SoHK_2.2">2.2</a> UNCOORDINATED EFFORTS</h2><p>An uncoordinated effort occurs whenever a group of people are working together towards a common goal, but there is no clear master craftsman or organizer. Examples of such a situation might include a group (or pair) of people rowing a boat, or a group of spell casters all working towards the same ritual.<br />In this situation, the average bonus for the applicable skill should be determined. A single maneuver roll is made, and the average skill bonus is applied as a modifier.
<pre><strong>Group Bonus for a Coordinated Maneuver</strong> = 
Average of the skill bonuses of the group
</pre>Whereas the average bonus might be significantly smaller than that of the best participant, by pooling one's efforts, tasks can be accomplished in a fraction of the time it would normally take to complete the task. The following formula indicates how many times faster the task will be accomplished than normal.
<pre>(Max + 1 - N) x (N) -;- (Max)
</pre>Max indicates the maximum number of people that could work together (normally twice the number that could comfortably work together). N indicates the number of people currently working together. Note that if Max is very large, then the product is roughly equal to N.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> In a given kitchen, only 4 people can work together due to space constraints. 3 cooks are working on preparing dinner. Dinner could be made by one person in 60 minutes. These cooks can complete the task (4 + 1 - 3) &times; 3 + 4 = 1.5 times faster than normal, orin 40 minutes. Ifthey could find additional space so that up to 6 cooks could possibly work together, then the dinner would be finished in 30 minutes.
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="SoHK_2.3">2.3</a> COORDINATED EffORTS</h2>
<p>When there is a distinct leader or master craftsman coordinating the efforts of a group, the effective skill bonus of the group might be much higher (or lower) than in the uncoordinated circumstance. The group's skill bonus is based on the smallest skill bonus in the group. The leader then adds one to this value for every skill rank he has in the skill, minus one for each person he is coordinating, plus the number of ranks he has in <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Leadership">Leadership</a>. The bonus from Leadership cannot exceed the number of people being coordinated.
<pre><strong>Group Bonus for a Coordinated Maneuver</strong> = 
smallest skill bonus in the group (may be modified) 
+ leader's skill rank- number of group members (other than the leader) 
+ leader's skill ranks in Leadership (limited)
</pre>The leader can also assist the less skilled members of his staff. The leader can divide his skill rank bonus among any members of his staff as he sees fit. This will temporarily increase their skill, possibly elevating the group's overall bonus.</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> Glim is attempting to sow the seeds of rebellion. He and a group of friends are attempting to perform a coordinated propaganda drive. Glim has 15 ranks of <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Propaganda">Propaganda</a> and 5 ranks of <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Leadership">Leadership</a>. His friends' skill bonuses (in Propaganda) are +30, +45, +50 and +75. Glim divides his +40 skill rank bonus among his first three friends, increasing their bonuses to +55, +55, +55 and +75, respectively. The smallest skill bonus is now +55, to which Glim adds 15 - 4 + 4 = 15. The group's overall Propaganda skill bonus for a coordinated group maneuver is +70. If we assume that Glim's Propaganda bonus is +100, the group's average skill bonus (for an uncoordinated group maneuver) would only be +60 = [(100 + 30 + 45 + 50 + 75) &div; 5].
</blockquote>
<p>The amount of time required to complete a coordinated maneuver is equivalent to that of an uncoordinated effort (see <a href="#SoHK_2.2">Section 2.2</a>). Note that the leader does not count as a participant if his staff is larger than the number of ranks he has in <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Leadership">Leadership</a>.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Continuing the above example, since a nearly unlimited number of people could blanket the city with pamphlets, the task can be accomplished in one fifth ofthe time normally required.
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="SoHK_2.4">2.4</a> AIDED MANEUVERS</h2><p>An aided maneuver is the converse of the coordinated maneuver. In this case a single person is attempting a maneuver, but he is being assisted by a number of people. For example, a general will often have a staff of tacticians in order to increase his Tactics bonus. The amount of time required to complete the maneuver is not reduced by the aid, but the character performing the maneuver has his skill bonus temporarily increased.<br />The character's skill bonus is increased by the total number of ranks of the skill possessed by his aides. This number is reduced by the number of aides, squared. It is possible to have one's skill bonus reduced by listening to too many assistants.</p>
<pre>
<strong>Modification for an Aided Maneuver</strong> =character's normal skill bonus 
+ aides' total skill ranks- (# aides &times; # aides)
</pre>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Talen is planning a raid. He asks three ofhis friends for assistance. They have 3, 7 and 10 ranks of Tactics, respectively. Talen's <a href="../em.lproj/skills.html#Tactics">Tactics</a> bonus is increased by 20 - 9 = 11. If he asked three more friends for help, each of whom had 3 ranks of tactics, his skill bonus would be modified by -7 = (3+7+10+3+3+3) - (6x6). It's good to keep the advisory board small.
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="SoHK_2.5">2.5</a> SUBSEQUENT MANEUVERS</h2><p>A subsequent maneuver occurs whenever a given maneuver must be completed before a second maneuver can be attempted. For example, a piece of music must be composed before it can be performed.<br />The GM should first determine the order in which the skills involved should be resolved. If the maneuvers are truly sequential, the order is obvious. If one or more of the maneuvers are occurring simultaneously, the GM must decide which skill is most significant. That skill is resolved last.</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> A figure-skater is competing in ice-dancing. The GM decides that a <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Dance">Dance</a> maneuver is the true goal of the maneuver, but that a <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Skating">Skating</a> maneuver must also be completed.
</blockquote><p>To determine the success of the complete maneuver, the character attempts the first maneuver. If successful, the subsequent maneuver bonus (the final number on every Static Maneuver Table) is applied to the next maneuver.<br />The GM must also determine if the preliminary maneuvers are required to complete the overall maneuver. In the prior example, a failed Skating maneuver would indicate that the <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Dancing">Dancing</a> maneuver also failed. However, some skills are used simply to gain the subsequent maneuver bonus (e.g., <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Balance">Adrenal Balance</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Meditation">Meditation</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Advanced_Math">Advanced Math</a>). For example, it is not necessary for a character to successfully complete an <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Advanced_Math">Advanced Math</a> maneuver before attempting an <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Architecture">Architecture</a> maneuver, but it may be necessary before attempting an Engineering maneuver.<br />If the character performing the preliminary maneuver is not the one performing the subsequent maneuver, any bonus resulting from the first maneuver should be halved. It is possible for a number of people to pass the subsequent maneuver bonus from one to another, provided each maneuver is successful.<br />When there are multiple skills being strung together, the overall maneuver is successful if every required maneuver results in Near Success or better. Characters can normally not re-roll Near and Partial Successes when attempting a sequential maneuver.</p>
<h2><a name="SoHK_2.6">2.6</a> MANEUVER DURATION</h2><p>The amount of time needed to complete a maneuver depends on the maneuver being made and its difficulty. In general, the GM determines how long it will take to complete a given maneuver; this duration is modified by results from the various Static Maneuver Tables.<br />If the GM is interested in a more dynamic approach, the Moving Maneuver Table can be used. The GM determines how many points must be obtained, and how often the character gets to roll. For example, picking a lock might require 600 points, but the character gets to roll every round. Constructing a house might require 300 points; the character rolls each month.<br />The average amount of time is roughly equal to the number of points needed times the amount of time between rolls. The above examples would take 6 rounds and 3 months to complete, on average.<br />The character makes a maneuver roll, modified by his skill and all other modifiers, not including difficulty. The result should be indexed on the Moving Maneuver Table. If the result is a numeric result, the character gains that many points. Any other good result gives the character 150 points. Any bad results provide the character with no points. In some situations, the GM may even reduce the number of points gained if the maneuver roll is particularly bad.<br />Any subsequent maneuver bonuses or aided maneuver bonuses apply to each roll, not just the first.<br />Once the skill is completed, the character should make a final maneuver roll and reference the result on the Static Maneuver Table. If the result is less than a complete Success, the procedure may begin anew. Subsequent and aided maneuver bonuses would then be lost.</p>
<h2><a name="SoHK_2.7">2.7</a> VARIABLE STAT BONUSES</h2><p>Normally, all skills within a category use the same stat bonuses. If a GM wishes a finer granularity in individualizing skills, he can assign two stat bonuses to the category and then a third to each individual skill. The two stats assigned to a category are the same as the first two stats given for the category in <em>RMFRP</em> and <em>ChL</em>).<br />Each skill description (<a href="#SoHK_6.0">Section 6.0</a>) gives three stats under "Optional Stats Used." When using this optional rule, each skill category bonus uses the first two stat bonuses given. Then, each skill gets a special bonus that is equal to the stat bonus for the third stat given.<br />The net result is that 3 stat bonuses affect each skill bonus (just as they do if this optional rule is not used).</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> The <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Awareness_Searching">Awareness &bull; Searching</a> category has eight skills listed in it. The stats that give the stat bonuses for the category are "In/Re/SD." If this optional rule is being used, the skill category bonus would be figured as normal, except that only the In and Re stat bonuses would be added in. As each skill is developed, it would receive a special bonus equal to the stat bonus for the individual skill. <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Detect Traps">Detect Traps</a> and <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Locate_Hidden">Locate Hidden</a> would get a special bonus equal to the <dfn>In</dfn> stat bonus. <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Lie_Perception">Lie Perception</a> would get a special bonus equal to the Em stat bonus. <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Poison_Perception">Poison Perception</a> would get a bonus equal to the <dfn>Me</dfn> stat bonus. <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Observation">Observation</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Reading Tracks">Reading Tracks</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Surveillance">Surveillance</a>, and <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Tracking">Tracking</a> would get a special bonus equal to the <dfn>SD</dfn> stat bonus.
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="SoHK_2.8">2.8</a> EXTENDED EXAMPLE</h2>
<blockquote id="example">A minor lord desires to have a manor built. He hires an architect, Bob, who in tum hires 3 drafters and a team of carpenters.<br>Bob begins by attempting an optional <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Advanced_Math">Advanced Math</a> maneuver. Since he is not a mathematical genius (his bonus is only +30), he asks two of his academy buddies, Joe and Bill for help. They each have 5 skill ranks in <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Advanced_Math">Advanced Math</a>, and so they provide an aided maneuver bonus of (5 + 5 - (2 &times; 2) = 6). Bob rolls an aided <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Advanced_Math">Advanced Math</a> maneuver and rolls an 89. His total is (89 + 30 + 6 = 125) which is a Success.<br>Since his maneuver was successful, Bob can apply twice the subse· quent maneuver bonus (+20 &times; 2 = +40) to his <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Architecture">Architecture</a> maneuver (see <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Advanced_Math">Advanced Math</a>). He must then complete a required <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Architecture">Architecture</a> maneuver. The GM considers the situation and determines that this will be a Medium maneuver. If this maneuver is not successful the project will be a disaster, although this may not be evident until much later! His <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Architecture">Architecture</a> skill bonus is +30, and he rolls a 16, so his final result is (16 + 30 + 40 = 86) a Partial Success.<br>Since the <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Architecture">Architecture</a> maneuver was successful, half of the subsequent maneuver bonus (+5 &div; 2 = 2.5 = 3) is passed along to his three drafters. Not wanting to micro-manage, Bob does not attempt to coordinate their efforts. The drafters make a Medium <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Drafting">Drafting</a> maneuver, using their average <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Drafting">Drafting</a> bonus of +15. Since their workspace could comfortably house four people, the GM decides that the maximum number of drafters that could work together is eight. Thus, the drafting project is completed ((8 + 1 - 3) x 3 &div; 8 = 2.25) times as fast as normal.<br>The lead drafter rolls a 90 for his maneuver, giving a combined result of (90 + 15 + 3 = 108). One half of the subsequent maneu· ver bonus (+10 &div; 2 = 5) is passed along to the carpenters. The master carpenter (skill rank bonus of+30, category bonus of +20) is coordinating his staff of 5 carpenters (with skill rank bonuses of +5, +10, +15, +20 and +20), so he must decide how to allocate his skill rank bonus among his staff He decides to allocate 15 points to the least skilled worker, 10 points to the next most skilled and 5 points to the next most skilled. Once he has allocated his rank bonus, all bonuses are equal so the smallest bonus is +20.<br>The GM decides that the manor will take an average of six months to complete. He requires that the carpenters roll each month until they accumulate 600 points. These rolls are modified by the master carpenter's number of ranks in <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Leadership">Leadership</a> (3) and <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Carpentry">Carpentry</a> (6) minus the number of workers (5), plus half of the drafters' subsequent maneuver bonus (5). Thus, each monthly roll is modified by (+20 + 3 + 6 - 5 + 5 = 29) and cross·referenced on the Moving Maneuver Table until 600 points are achieved.<br />
After accumulating 600 points, the carpenters make a final <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Carpentry">Carpentry</a> static maneuver roll. The master carpenter (<a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Carpentry">Carpentry</a> skill bonus of +50) rolls a 45 and gets a result of (45 + 50 = 95) a Near Success. This indicates that the structure is 80% complete. The carpenters must now accumulate another (600 * 20% = 120) points before the building is finished. The carpenters do not gain the benefit of the drafters' subsequent maneuver bonus on remaining maneuver rolls, but the Near Success does provide them with a +10 bonus instead.<br />
Once these 120 points are accumulated, the manor will be complete if the final <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Carpentry">Carpentry</a> maneuver result is a Success. As the project nears completion, it becomes clear to Bob whether or not he succeeded his initial <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Architecture">Architecture</a> maneuver.

<h1><a name="SoHK_3.0">3.0</a> Skill Development</h1>
<p>These optional rules cover the specialization and generalization of the development of certain skills.</p>
<h4><a name="SoHK_3.0.0.1">3.0.0.1</a> SPECIALIZATION</h4><p>This option allows a character to focus his skill proficiencies more finely. Many skills (e.g., <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#History">History</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Religion">Religion</a>, etc.) allow a character either to develop a broad understanding of an entire field or to develop a more precise understanding of a sub-field. Other skills provide a character with a similarly diverse set of abilities. See the skill descriptions in <a href="#SoHK_6.0">Section 6.0</a> for recommended specializations for each skill (some skills have none).<br>Specialization allows a character to select a sub-field of a skill in which he is an expert. If a maneuver roll falls within the character's specialty, he temporarily doubles the number of skill ranks he has in that skill. If the character cannot develop skill in the category (e.g., <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Spells">Spells</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Awareness_Perceptions">Awareness &bull; Perceptions</a>, etc.), the character temporarily increases the number of ranks in the skill by 50%.<br>To gain a specialization, a character must sacrifice a skill rank to the specialization when purchasing skills. This does not increase the number of ranks that can be bought in a given skill, however. For example, a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Ranger">Ranger</a> wants to develop a specialization in <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Rigid_Leather">Rigid Leather</a>. Upon attaining level 2, he purchases three ranks of <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Rigid_Leather">Rigid Leather</a>. Two of these ranks are devoted to increasing his skill in <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Rigid_Leather">Rigid Leather</a>, the other towards specializing in AT 10. He could not purchase three ranks and sacrifice a fourth to gain a specialization because he can only develop three ranks of Rigid Leather per level.<br>
It is not possible to specialize in a skill category. Suggested specializations are provided for each skill in <a href="SoHK_6.0">Section 6.0</a>.<br>The GM should carefully consider any proposed specialization to ensure that its parameters are sufficiently narrow. If a specialization is constructed such that a small number of specializations would cover every possible circumstance, the specialization is too broad.<br>It is strongly recommended that a character only have one specialization per combat skill (e.g., weapon skills, combat maneuvers, etc.) to prevent abuse of this option. A character may have multiple specializations in other skills.
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> Anton, the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Paladin">Paladin</a>, is not interested in learning general <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Religion">Religion</a>. Instead, he specializes in the religion to which he belongs. He has 12 ranks in religion. These 12 ranks can be applied towards any religion, but if he needs information pertaining to his own religion, he has 24 ranks. Note that he has actually purchased 13 ranks, but had to sacrifice one in order to gain the specialization.</blockquote>Note that once a character has a specialization, he keeps that specialization until it is replaced by another specialization. Any ranks devoted to specializations are lost; a character cannot recover the rank by losing the specialization.</p>
<h4><a name="SoHK_3.0.0.2">3.0.0.2</a> GENERALIZATION</h4><p>This option is the converse of specialization. Many skills require that a character develop the skill for each sub-category of the skill (e.g., <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Weapons">Weapons</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Riding">Riding</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Metal-crafts">Metal-crafts</a>, etc.). This option allows a character to learn all possible versions of the skill simultaneously.<br>If the skill is an Occupational or Everyman skill, it becomes a regular skill. If the skill is a regular skill, it becomes a Restricted skill. Restricted skills cannot be generalized. Once a skill is generalized, it can be used regardless of the sub-category. For example, a generalization in Riding would allow a character to ride horses, elephants and warcats equally well.<br>A skill cannot be both generalized and specialized. The GM may also decide that some generalizations do not apply to every sub-category, but rather a closely related group of sub-categories (e.g., a generalization in swords, rather than in one-handed edged weapons).</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> Genn, the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Animist">Animist</a>, purchases <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Animal_Healing">Animal Healing</a> as a generalization. Normally, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Animal_Healing">Animal Healing</a> would a normal skill for her. Since she has generalized, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Animal_Healing">Animal Healing</a> becomes a Restricted skill. She purchases a total offour ranks in <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Animal_Healing">Animal Healing</a> (resulting in the acquisition oftwo ranks), but this skill can now be applied to any animal.</blockquote>

<h1><a name="SoHK_4.0">4.0</a> Healing</h1>
<p><a href="5800.html#RMFRP_24.1">Section 24.1</a> of <em>RMFRP</em> provides guidelines for the length of time it takes to heal from an injury. These guidelines assume natural healing only. The following sections describe the effects of various healing maneuvers and how difficult they are to perform. The following skills are considered healing skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Animal_Healing">Animal Healing</a></li>
<li><a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Diagnostics">Diagnostics</a></li>

<li><a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Surgery">Surgery</a></li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="SoHK_4.0.0.1">4.0.0.1</a> GENERAL EFFECTS</h4><p>In general, use of a healing skill will reduce the amount of time it takes for a wound to heal. Without <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#First_Aid">First Aid</a>, many wounds will kill a character before natural healing is relevant, particularly when the victim is bleeding. <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#First_Aid">First Aid</a> is useful for stabilizing a victim, but a successful <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#First_Aid">First Aid</a> maneuver will not reduce the amount of time needed for a wound to heal. <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#First_Aid">First Aid</a> will help prevent re-injury. First Aid can also be applied to oneself (unlike any of the other healing skills).<br>A successful <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Second_Aid">Second Aid</a> maneuver will reduce the amount of time needed to heal by 25%. Thus, a wound that would normally take 12 days to heal will take only 9 days to heal. In addition, a <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Second_Aid">Second Aid</a> maneuver will reduce the penalty associated with the wound by 25%. Thus, a penalty of -40 would be reduced to -30.<br>Surgery is an intrusive process. It is needed when a limb must be amputated, or when a foreign object must be removed from the victim. Because of the traumatic nature of surgery, the amount of time needed to recover is not reduced, but Surgery might allow the victim to survive injuries otherwise fatal. A wound treated with <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Surgery">Surgery</a> or <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Second_Aid">Second Aid</a> allows the victim to add the subsequent maneuver bonus to his roll to prevent Nerve Damage. (See <em>RMFRP</em>)<br><a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Diagnostics">Diagnostics</a> is needed whenever a victim is affected by a poison or physical illness. <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Diagnostics">Diagnostics</a> is used to identify the symptoms of the ailment and prescribe an appropriate treatment and/or diet. <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Diagnostics">Diagnostics</a> can also be used to estimate a patient's chance of survival (prognosis).<br><a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Psychology">Psychology</a> is used to diagnose and treat mental illnesses. Of all of the healing skills, this one is the most difficult and time intensive. For a <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Psychology">Psychology</a> maneuver to have any chance of success, the victim must be willing to undergo treatment. If this is not the case, the psychologist can still diagnose the malady, but he may not make a maneuver to cure the affliction.</p>
<h4><a name="SoHK_4.0.0.2">4.0.0.2</a> Bleeding</h4>
<p>Bleeding wounds recover on the Skin/Tissue portion of the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#RMFFRP_T-5.4">Healing Recovery Table T-5.4</a> (<em>RMFRP</em>). A Light wound is any wound that is bleeding 1-5 hits per round. A Medium wound is one that is bleeding 6-10 hits per round. A Severe wound is bleeding 11 or more hits per round.<br><a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#First_Aid">First Aid</a> can be used to stop up to 5 hits per round due to bleeding by applying direct pressure to the wound and/or presure points. This is a Medium maneuver. If the victim performs any action more rigorous than walking, the wound will reopen.<br><a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#First_Aid">First Aid</a> can also be used to stop more serious bleeding by using a tourniquet. A tourniquet must be loosened frequently, or the limb will die. This maneuver is Easy, but a result of Partial or Near Success indicates that the limb is lost.<br><a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Second_Aid">Second Aid</a> or <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Surgery">Surgery</a> can be used to stitch a wound. <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Second_Aid">Second Aid</a> can stitch a Light or Medium wound; Surgery can stitch any wound (that does not involve the loss of a limb). A wound that has been stitched is less likely to reopen. Every round of activity, the victim should roll and add the subsequent maneuver bonus provided by the <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Second_Aid">Second Aid</a> or <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Surgery">Surgery</a> maneuver and subtract 5 for every round of bleeding. If the result is zero or greater, the wound remains closed.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Eirik stitches Kregon's arm after a fight. Eirik's <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Surgery">Surgery</a> maneuver results in an unusual success (+30). Kregon was bleeding 8 hits per round. Every round ofhe is active, he must roll and subtract 10 (30 - 8 &times; 5) - if the result is less than 0, the wound reopens.
</blockquote>
<p>Any character can cauterize a wound, provided he has a torch or a hot metal object. The character should make a <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#First_Aid">First Aid</a> maneuver. A Spectacular or Absolute Failure inflicts a D Heat critical and 4d10 hits and does not stop any bleeding. A Failure inflicts a C Heat critical and 3d10 hits, but half of the bleeding is stopped. A Partial or Near Success stops all of the bleeding and inflicts a B Heat critical and 2d10 hits. A Success inflicts an A Heat critical and 1d10 hits; an Unusual or Absolute Success causes no damage.</p>
<h4><a name="SoHK_4.0.0.3">4.0.0.3</a> Bone Injuries</h4>
<p>A simple fracture with a penalty of -20 or less is a Light wound. Any compound fracture, fracture with no specified penalty, or fracture with a penalty of -50 or less is considered a Medium wound. All shatters and fractures with a penalty of worse than -50 are Severe.<br><a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#First_Aid">First Aid</a> can be used to create a crude splint. This is a Medium maneuver for Light wounds and a Very Hard maneuver for Medium wounds. If a victim does not have a splint, he must roll whenever he maneuvers at faster than a walk. If the roll is less than the penalty (taken as a positive number), the penalty increases by 10.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Kregon broke a rib (-5 penalty). The next round of combat he must roll. He rolls an 04. This is less than 5, so the penalty for the broken rib increases to -15. Another such increase, and the broken rib becomes a Medium wound.</blockquote>
<p><a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Second_Aid">Second Aid</a> can be used to design a more permanent brace or setting. This is a Hard or Very Hard maneuver depending on whether the wound is Light/Medium or Severe. Setting a shatter is Absurd. Once the victim has such a brace, he can use the limb with little threat of re-injury.<br><a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Surgery">Surgery</a> is the best option for a shattered limb. The limb must be amputated to prevent gangrene. This is a Light maneuver.</p>
<h4><a name="SoHK_4.0.0.4">4.0.0.4</a> Burns</h4>
<p>Any critical that results in a light burn indicates a Light wound. A critical that results in a minor/medium burn or causes 1-5 hits per round of damage indicates a Medium wound. Any critical that results in a severe burn, causes 6 or more hits per round of damage, or involves the loss of a limb indicates a Severe wound.<br><a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#First_Aid">First Aid</a> can be used to treat Light and Medium wounds by applying cool water and a bandage. This is an Easy maneuver that restores 1-5 hits and prevents the possibility of blisters becoming infected. If <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#First_Aid">First Aid</a> is not administered, the wound will take twice as long to heal due to skin irritation.<br><a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Second_Aid">Second Aid</a> can also be used and usually includes the application of a salve. This is a Light maneuver.<br><a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Second_Aid">Second Aid</a> or <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Surgery">Surgery</a> can be used in the case of a Severe wound. The victim needs to have the burnt skin removed, and the wound properly dressed. This gory task is a Hard maneuver.</p><h4><a name="SoHK_4.0.0.5">4.0.0.5</a> CARTILAGE &. LIGAMENT INJURIES (SPRAINS &. STRAINS)</h4>
<p>Injuries of this type recover on the Muscle/Tendon portion of the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#RMFRP_T-5.4">Healing Recovery Table T-5.4</a> (<em>RMFRP</em>). The number of days needed for recovery should automatically be doubled. The penalty associated with the injury indicates the severity of the wound: -20 or less indicates a Light wound, -21 to -50 indicates a Medium wound, and a penalty of more than -50 indicates a Severe wound.<br>First Aid can be used to brace a Light wound. This helps protect the victim from re-injury. This is a Light maneuver. If the victim does not have a brace, he must roll whenever he maneuvers at faster than a walk. If the number is less than the penalty (taken as a positive number), the penalty increases by 5. Once the injury is braced, the victim need only make such a roll when he fails a Moving Maneuver.<br>Second Aid can also be used to create a brace suitable for a Light or Medium wound. This is a Light maneuver. Torn ligaments can also be braced, but this is a Hard maneuver.<br>A surgeon can attempt to reconnect a severed ligament, but this is an Absurd maneuver. Failure indicates that the wound will never heal.</p>
<h4><a name="SoHK_4.0.0.6">4.0.0.6</a> Head Injuries</h4>
<p>If a victim suffers a head injury, any healing maneuver performed on that injury is increased by one difficulty level. In addition, head wounds Healing are slow to heal.</p>
<h4><a name="SoHK_4.0.0.7">4.0.0.7</a> MUSCLE/TENDON INJURIES</h4><p>The penalty associated with the injury indicates the severity of the wound: -20 or less indicates a Light wound, -21 to -50 indicates a Medium wound, and a penalty of more than -50 indicates a Severe wound.<br><a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#First_Aid">First Aid</a> can be used to bind a Light wound. This is a Light maneuver. First Aid can do nothing for more serious injuries.<br>If <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#First_Aid">First Aid</a> is not administered, the victim risks re-injuring himself. Whenever the victim attempts a maneuver more rigorous than a walk, he must roll below the penalty taken as a positive number, or the penalty increases by 10.<br><a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Surgery">Surgery</a> can be attempted to close more serious injuries. This is a Medium or Hard maneuver, depending on whether the wound is Medium or Severe. If the muscle or tendon was severed, this becomes an Absurd maneuver.</p>
<h4><a name="SoHK_4.0.0.8">4.0.0.8</a> NERVE INJURIES</h4><p>There is nothing that can be done for a nerve injury. The victim needs a magical herb or spell to recover from the injury.</p>
<h4><a name="SoHK_4.0.0.9">4.0.0.9</a> ORGAN INJURIES</h4><p>The penalty associated with the injury indicates the severity of the wound: -20 or less indicates a Light wound, -21 to -50 indicates a Medium wound, and a penalty of more than -50 indicates a Severe wound.<br>There is not much that can be done when an organ is injured. In the case of a Light wound, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#First_Aid">First Aid</a> or <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Second_Aid">Second Aid</a> can be used to cover the wound. This is a Sheer Folly or Extremely Hard maneuver. Until a successful maneuver is made, the victim must roll once per day. If the roll is below the penalty (taken as a positive number), that day does not count towards healing.</p><blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> A small creature scratches Kregon's eye. As a result, his vision suffers a penalty o f -20. Kregon rolls on the Healing Recovery Table, and determines that his eye will heal in 3 days. However, until Eirik administers First Aid, there is a 20% chance per day that Kregon will not get to count that day towards recovery.
</blockquote>
<p>If the wound is Medium or Severe, surgery is required. This is an Extremely Hard or Absurd maneuver.<br>Note that any organ that has been destroyed will not heal without magical intervention. Loss of a single eye may only result in a penalty of -50 to vision maneuvers,  but this Medium wound will not heal.</p>
<h4><a name="SoHK_4.0.0.10">4.0.0.10</a> SHOCK</h4><p>Nearly all injuries require treatment for shock. The GM may rule that no other treatment can be administered until the healer treats for shock. Any injury that results in death in a given number of rounds can be delayed as long as <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#First_Aid">First Aid</a> is successfully administered. Shock treatment will also stop the loss of hits per round from burn injuries (since such damage indicates shock damage and not bleeding damage). Preventing death is an Extremely Hard maneuver; normal shock treatment is an Easy maneuver (subject to a penalty of -5 for every hit per round of shock damage).<br><a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Second_Aid">Second Aid</a> can also be used to temporarily revive a victim unconscious due to shock damage. If the victim's hits can be brought above zero the round he is revived (by consuming an herb, for example), he remains conscious. This Is a Sheer Folly maneuver.</p>
<h4><a name="SoHK_4.0.0.11">4.0.0.11</a> SKIN/TISSUE INJURIES</h4><p>Any injury that does not specify specific damage is considered to be a flesh wound. This includes any injury that causes bleeding and a generic maneuver penalty. The penalty associated with the injury indicates the severity of the wound: -20 or less indicates a Light wound, -21 to -50 indicates a Medium wound, and a penalty of more than -50 indicates a Severe wound.<br>First Aid or Second Aid can be used to dress the injury. This is a Light, Medium or Hard maneuver, depending on the severity of the injury. A successful maneuver allows the victim to apply the subsequent maneuver bonus to any resistance rolls versus infection. Healers may voluntarily provide skin dressings in order to provide their patients with this bonus, even if the injury is deeper than a flesh wound.</p>
<h4><a name="SoHK_4.0.0.12">4.0.0.12</a> DISEASES</h4><p>Bubonic diseases are the bane of every warrior. Every day that a character has an open wound, he must make a RR vs. a bubonic disease of a random level (1-10). This check must be made twice per day if the character is in a battlefield or other unsanitary situation. An RR should also be made once each month regardless of injuries, or once each week in unsanitary conditions.<br>Bubonic diseases can be treated using <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Diagnostics">Diagnostics</a>. A successful maneuver indicates that the healer has identified the disease. If the victim maintains the prescribed regiment of food and exercise (and prayer), the amount of time needed for recovery will be reduced by 25%. If the RR originally indicated an Extreme result, the victim may also make an additional RR (to avoid dying). If the second RR also indicates an Extreme result, the victim dies. (Bloodletting is another common treatment. The GM may consider giving the healer a bonus of +5 to a <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Diagnostics">Diagnostics</a> maneuver if he succeeds at a Light <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Surgery">Surgery</a> maneuver.)<br>
Chemical diseases can be treated with <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Psychology">Psychology</a>. If the psychologist is successful, the victim may add the subsequent maneuver bonus to the Withdrawal roll. (See <em>Gamemaster Law</em>) This greatly increases a victim's chances of surviving withdrawal.<br>
Neither <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Diagnostics">Diagnostics</a>, nor <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Psychology">Psychology</a> can assist a character with a genetic disease. If the disease is healed magically, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Psychology">Psychology</a> can be used to reduce the recovery time by 25%.<br>Pneumonic diseases can strike at any time. Each month a character should make an RR versus a pneumonic disease (of a random level, 1-10). If conditions are crowded, this check should be made once each week. Pneumonic diseases are treated using <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Diagnostics">Diagnostics</a> in a manner identical to bubonic diseases.<br>Psychiatric diseases can be treated using <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Psychology">Psychology</a>. Until the victim receives treatment, he will not recover from a psychiatric disease. The amount of time needed to recover depends on the severity of the disease.<br>Note that trephination (removing a button of bone from the skull) is a more common approach to psychiatric illnesses in a medieval setting. This is a Very Hard <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Second_Aid">Second Aid</a> maneuver. If the GM is generous, he might give this procedure a 10% chance of success.<br>Reducing an Extreme disease to Severe requires a year of treatment. During this time, the psychologist must make a successful maneuver roll each month, or begin again. In addition, if the victim is not monitored closely, suicide or self-injury is a serious threat.<br>Reducing a Severe illness to Moderate requires one month for every six months that the victim has lived with the illness. The psychologist must make a successful maneuver roll each month, or begin from scratch. An Absolute Failure (or worse) results in the victim's condition worsening. These patients generally require constant supervision.<br>Curing a Moderate illness requires one month of outpatient therapy for every year the victim has had the condition. Curing a Mild illness requires therapy for one month for every two years the victim has had the affliction. The psychologist should make a maneuver roll each month, but a Failure does not require the psychologist to start over. An Absolute Failure causes the victim's condition to worsen.<br>The difficulty of any <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Diagnostics">Diagnostics</a> or <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Psychology">Psychology</a> maneuver depends on the severity of the illness. A Mild case is Easy to treat. A Moderate case is a Medium maneuver. A Severe case is Very Hard to treat, and an Extreme case is Sheer Folly (at best).</p>
<h4><a name="SoHK_4.0.0.13">4.0.0.13</a> Poisons</h4>
<p><a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#First_Aid">First</a> or <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Second_Aid">Second Aid</a> can be used to prevent a poison from taking effect, provided the treatment is administered before any symptoms manifest. This treatment involves making a small incision and drawing the toxin out of the blood. If the poison was ingested, the healer must instead induce vomiting. This difficulty of either maneuver depends on the severity of the RR failure:</p><table summary="" >

<h1><a name="SoHK_5.0">5.0</a> Skill Categories</h1>
<p>The following sections provide options and general modifiers for all of the skill categories in <em>RMFRP</em> and <em>Character Law</em>. Most of the sections each cover a skill category or a group of skill categories (e.g., the <a href="SoHK_5.3">Awareness</a> skill categories). However, there are two general sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Combat Skills</strong> &mdash; Skills from the following skill categories: Armor skill categories, Body Development, Combat Maneuvers, Martial Arts, Special Attacks, Special Defenses, and Weapon. See <a href="SoHK_5.4">Section 5.4</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Power Skills</strong> &mdash; Skills from the following skill categories: Directed Spells, Power Awareness, Power Manipulation, Power Point Development, and Spells. See <a href="#SoHK_5.10">Section 5.10</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="SoHK_5.1">5.1</a> ARTISTIC SKILLS</h2><p>There are two types of artistic skills: passive and active. The goal of an artistic maneuver is the same, regardless of the category. The artist seeks to design a work of art, an object or performance of beauty and emotion. The artist expresses himself by presenting his work to the audience (in the gallery, on stage, or in the library).<br>The goal of an artistic maneuver is not the accumulation of wealth, although many artists would welcome fame and the accompanying wealth. Indeed, the greatness of an artist depends in large part on his audience's perception.<br>The difficulty of an artistic maneuver generally captures the depth or significance of the subject matter. The maneuver roll then indicates the beauty and elegance of the art. If the product of these two factors is determined, one can approximate the greatness of the result.<br>
In more specific terms, the following formula indicates how widely known a given piece of art is generally recognized. Within this radius, the art can be considered part of the local culture. Beyond this radius, the public's familiarity with the piece of art diminishes until only serious collectors and fans are familiar with the art.</p><pre>
(Difficulty Level &times; (Maneuver Roll - 100) &div; 20)<sup>2</sup> in miles
</pre>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> onya performs at the local pub. She is a fairly gifted flautist who attempts a Hard (DL = 5) maneuver. The maneuver roll results in a 165 after modifications. This impressive feat is mentioned as much as 264 miles away (= [5 &times; (165-100) &div; 20)<sup>2</sup>).</blockquote>
<p>An artist's fame grows and shrinks more slowly than the fame of a specific piece or performance. Each time the artist produces a work, his sphere of fame increases by one tenth of the difference or decreases by one twentieth of the difference, as appropriate.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> If Sonya had a sphere of fame equal to 100 miles, her fame would increase by 16.5 miles (= (265 - 100) &div; 10). If she previously had a sphere offame of 400 miles (Wow!), her sphere would shrink by 7 miles (= (265 - 400) &div; 20).
</blockquote>
<p>Over time, an artist's fame will be roughly equal to that of his works. Once the artist dies, his work may still gain fame, provided there is some way for future generations to enjoy the work (i.e., the art is passive, not active). If the artist had more than 10 ranks in his art, his reputation's sphere of fame will grow by a percentage equal to the number of ranks above 10, each decade. If the artist had fewer than 10 ranks, the sphere of fame will shrink by a percentage equal to the number of ranks fewer than 11, every five years. Note that an artist does not necessarily need to die for this to occur, he merely needs to stop producing work for five or more years.<br>The amount of time required to complete an artistic maneuver depends largely on the size (or length) of the artistic piece. In general, an artist can complete a piece of art of average size (depending on the medium) in 6 months to a year. This should be modified by the difficulty of the artistic maneuver. A simple sketch might take only a few minutes to complete, whereas a complete masterpiece might require years of effort. The GM  might allow the artist to roll the maneuver after spending one fourth of the time required. At this point, the artist can decide whether or not to continue.</p>
<h2><a name="SoHK_5.2">5.2</a> ATHLETIC SKILLS</h2><p>The Moving Maneuver Table can be used in a number of ways. The result from the table is often a number, which can be interpreted in a number of ways.<br>Allor Nothing: An all or nothing maneuver is a maneuver that either succeeds completely, or fails utterly. Examples include attempting to lift a great weight, and attempting to stop while skiing. The player must roll a second time and add the number from the chart. If the result is over 100, the maneuver succeeds.<br>Percentage: For these maneuvers, it is possible to succeed partially. This is definitely the case when attempting to maneuver a certain distance.<br>Both: Some.maneuvers may involve both of these options; these maneuvers are dangerous. There should be an obvious risk to the character to justify using this option. Examples might include climbing or tightrope walking. The danger of falling is very real.Athletic maneuvers require the expenditure of exhaustion points (EPs). Each such skill description includes the exhaustion point cost of the maneuver. This indicates the number of EPs that must be expended each round. The normal exhaustion point modifiers also apply.<br>
In addition, there is an exhaustion point modifier based on pace:</p>
<table summary="" >
<tr><th>Pace</th><th align="right">Exh. Pt. Modifier</th></tr>
<tr><td>Walk</td><td align="right">x1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Jog</td><td align="right">x2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Run</td><td align="right">x5</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sprint</td><td align="right">x120</td></tr>
<tr><td>Fast Sprint</td><td align="right">x360</td></tr>
<tr><td>Dash</td><td align="right">x3000</td></tr>
</table>
<img src="../shared/5808/C/Exhaustion_Modifier.png" alt="Exhaustion Modifier Chart" width="300" />
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Normally, acrobatics requires 1 exhaustion point every 6 rounds. An acrobatics maneuver performed at a sprint pace (x120) would cost 20 exhaustion points per round. This increases to 40 exhaustion points per round ifthe temperature is above 100&deg;F
</blockquote>
<p>For every 5 exhaustion points spent, the character's pool of available exhaustion points is reduced by one. This reflects the effects of prolonged exertion. This effect lasts until the character sleeps (or drowses, see <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Drawsing">Drawsing</a>). The character also loses one point from his pool of exhaustion points for every hour of consciousness.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> A charader with 40 exhaustion points fast sprints (6 EPs every round) for 5 rounds. This costs 30 exhaustion points. His pool of exhaustion points drops from 40 to 34; he currentlyhas 10 exhaustion points. After resting for a few minutes, he has recovered all of his available exhaustion points. However, until he sleeps, he cannot have more than 34 exhaustion points.
</blockquote>
<p>Most athletic skills also have a distance multiplier indicated. A character can normally maneuver a distance equal to his base movement rate each turn. The distance multiplier modifies this rate. Hence, skills like <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Climbing">Climbing</a> and <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Tightrope-walking">Tightrope-walking</a> are slow and methodical. Skills like <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Skiing">Skiing</a> and <a href=",,/en.lproj/skills.html#Flying">Flying</a> can be quite rapid. In addition, a character can increase this rate by increasing his pace. This costs more exhaustion points and may increase the difficulty of the maneuver. Most skills are ideally performed while walking, but some (like <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Jumping">Jumping</a>) require a different pace. Each pace category faster (or slower) than the ideal pace increases the difficulty by one.<br>The amount of weight carried also increases the difficulty of a maneuver:</p>
<table summary="" >
<tr><th>Wt. Penalty (before St mod.)</th><th align="right">Modification</th></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td align="right">-1 difficulty level</td></tr>
<tr><td>-1 &mdash; -10</td><td align="right">no modifier</td></tr>

<p>Note that the weight penalty also modifies a character's maximum pace. Even though this penalty can be offset by a character's Strength, wearing armor and carrying equipment greatly reduces a character's mobility. In addition, a character's Moving Maneuver Penalty will modify all moving maneuvers.<br>Athletic maneuvers must be resolved every round or every strategic turn. The maneuver is not complete until the character decides to stop maneuvering.</p>
<h2><a name="SoHK)5.3">5.3</a> AWARENESS SKILLS</h2><p>Most Awareness skills are based on visual observation. As a result, most Awareness maneuvers are modified by the lighting. Other obstructions (like fog or smoke) increase the difficulty of the maneuver.</p>
<table summary="" >
<tr><th>Lighting</th><th align="right">Modifier</th></tr>
<tr><td>Direct bright light</td><td align="right">-10</td></tr>
<tr><td>Indirect bright light</td><td align="right">+10</td></tr>
<tr><td>Medium light</td><td align="right">0</td></tr>

<tr><td>No light</td><td align="right">-100 (at best)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Races with excellent night vision can ignore these penalties, provided there is some source of light (like the moon). Races with dark vision (like Dwarves) can ignore these penalties within the range of their dark vision.<br>
Maneuvers that rely on other senses have the difficulty level of the maneuver modified by the background interference. There are no general modifiers.<br>Awareness maneuvers can be performed whenever the GM or character deem a maneuver roll to be appropriate. It usually takes a single round to complete an Awareness maneuver in a single direction (60&deg; field of vision) or one minute to complete an Awareness maneuver in all directions. An Awareness maneuver might take longer if a significant area must be searched (roughly one round for every 10' x 10' area examined closely enough to notice small objects).</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Searching one square mile for the prince's missing knife would require 775 man-hours = 32 days. A search o f this scope requires multiple people.

This may be modified by the normal exhaustion point modifiers. (See <a href="#SoHK_5.1">Section 5.1</a>.) If multiple combat skills are used simultaneously, the exhaustion point cost of each is applied.<br>
Combat skills (including attacks) can be used while maneuvering. It is often difficult to stop while maneuvering (e.g., while skiing or flying). The penalty associated with attacking while maneuvering depends on the difficulty of the maneuver:</p>

<strong>Note:</strong> The GM may allow characters to develop a skill called Moving Strike (in the <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Combat_Maneuver">Combat Maneuver</a> skill category). This skill must be developed separately for each type of maneuvering while attacking-for example, charging on foot, skiing, flying, etc. The Moving Strike skill bonus is only used to reduce (or eliminate) the penalty based upon the difficulty of the maneuver (see above).
</blockquote>
<p>If a character is moving faster than his opponent (e.g., he is charging) and attacking while maneuvering, the attack is not resolved in the usual manner. Initiative is based solely on the length of the weapons (or attacks) used. The longer weapon strikes first. The attacker and defender both receive a bonus of +1 for every 10 feet/round of speed. If both combatants are charging, this bonus can become quite large. Double this bonus for a combatant with a pole arm. Finally, if a combatant is not moving, and has braced his pole arm, he doubles the number of concussion hits inflicted.</p><blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Cedric is charging into battle with a spear. <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Sprinting">Sprinting</a> is an Easy maneuver for him, so he suffers a penalty of -5 to his attack. However, since he is moving 180/round, he receives a bonus of +36. His opponent is using a sword, which receives a bonus of+18. Cedric's weapon is longer, so he will strike first. If his opponent were also charging (at 150'/round), these bonuses would increase to +66 and +33, respedively.
</blockquote>
<p><a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Combat_Maneuver">Combat Maneuvers</a> must be resolved every round and are completed within the course of a round. Note that many <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Combat_Maneuver">Combat Maneuvers</a> do not require a maneuver roll.</p>
<h2><a name="SoHK_5.5">5.5</a> COMMUNICATION SKILLS</h2><p>A maneuver roll is generally not necessary when communicating, especially when player characters are communicating with other player characters. In most cases, a player should restrict his vocabulary to that of his character.<br>A maneuver roll is necessary if information must be communicated. Partial and Near Successes indicate that some of the information is not communicated.<br>A maneuver roll is also necessary whenever a player wants to temporarily increase another character's linguistic skill (i.e. tell him what to say). Note that all participants have their skill temporarily increased, so this option cannot be used to increase another player character's linguistic skill in order to communicate with someone else in secret.<br>The length of time required to complete a Communications maneuver depends on the length of the communication. Game time and real time transpire at equal rates while communicating.</p>
<h2><a name="SoHK_5.6">5.6</a> CRAFTS</h2><p>The goal of a crafter is the creation of some item. The difficulty of this attempt depends on the complexity of the object to be created, not on the size of the object. On the other hand, the size of the object to be created is the single most important factor when determining how long it will take to complete a project. Note that more difficult projects will automatically take longer than easier ones simply due to the fact that partial successes are more likely.<br>The average amount of time required to complete many common items is listed in <em>RMFRP</em> and <em>Gamemaster Law</em>. Other production times can be extrapolated from there; The length of time required to construct a building is described in <em>Castles & Ruins</em>.<br>A maneuver roll should not be made until the item is at least half finished. At this time, the GM may wish to allow the player to make the maneuver roll before deciding whether or not to finish the project.<br>
Note that all craftsmen require tools and supplies. A complete set of tools generally costs from 10 silver pieces (sp) to 1000 sp depending on the size of the workshop. In addition, the craftsman must purchase raw materials. These generally cost half as much as the item. It takes years for a craftsman to become rich.<br>Finally, many cities require craftsmen to belong to the appropriate guild, which will invariably require the craftsman to pay yearly dues of 1-10 sp. However, the craftsman is more likely to receive work when he belongs to a guild, and he can usually get a discount on raw materials (5-10%).</p>
<h2><a name="SoHK_5.7">5.7</a> INFLUENCE SKILLS</h2><p>Influence skills are one of the most difficult to quantify in any game. There are two main approaches to resolving Influence maneuvers. The appropriate solution depends on the skill of the player (at role playing) and the skill of the character (at the Influence skill).</p>
<blockquote id="option"><strong>Roll Playing:</strong> In many cases, the character has a much better idea how to get his way than does the player. In these cases, roll playing is an appropriate solution. Prior to role playing the influence attempt, the player should make a maneuver roll. The player then role plays the attempt in relation to the success of the maneuver. The GM should offer the appropriate amount of resistance. Note that this method of resolution requires greater skill on the part of player and GM alike.</blockquote><blockquote id="option"><strong>Role Playing:</strong> Some players are more comfortable role playing an influence attempt prior to making the maneuver roll. If the player's attempt is especially clever (or entertaining), the GM might give the character a bonus to the maneuver roll. The drawback of resolving Influence maneuvers in this manner is that the player must have some idea of how the character would accomplish the attempt.</blockquote><p>In reality, most GMs opt for a solution somewhere between these two extremes. The most important factor to keep in mind is that it is the character's skill that is most important, not the player's.<br>
Many Influence maneuvers can be completed in a few minutes. More difficult maneuvers will take longer. A Routine maneuver will generally take one minute to complete. Each increase in difficulty level doubles the amount of time required. The amount of time required for a <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Propaganda">Propaganda</a> maneuver is measured in days, not minutes.</p>
<blockquote id="example"><strong>Example:</strong> A Medium <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Duping">Duping</a> maneuver would take 8 minutes to complete. An Extremely Hard <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Propaganda">Propaganda</a> maneuver would take 64 days.</blockquote><p>The maneuver roll cannot be made until the entire time has elapsed. If the attempt is abandoned prior to this point, it will automatically fail. In addition, the GM might decide that similar attempts in the future will be more difficult.</p>
<h2><a name="SoHK_5.8">5.8</a> LORE SKILLS</h2><p>Lore skills can be resolved in one of two ways. The GM may want to provide each player with background information prior to play. The amount and type of information provided would depend on the character's skill in any relevant Lores. Alternatively, the player may desire a specific piece of information. This requires a maneuver roll during play.<br>The difficulty of a Lore maneuver depends entirely on the amount or depth of knowledge requested by the player. The obscurity of the information modifies what maneuvers can be attempted. See below.<br>The absolute number of ranks in a Lore determines the amount of knowledge the character has in the subject. For this reason, specialization is particularly useful with Lore skills. Determine the character's Knowledge Level on the table below:</p>
<table summary="" >
<tr><th>Ranks</th><th align="right">Knowledge Level</th></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td align="right">1</td></tr>
<tr><td>1-2</td><td align="right">2</td></tr>
<tr><td>3-4</td><td align="right">3</td></tr>
<tr><td>5-6</td><td align="right">4</td></tr>
<tr><td>7-9</td><td align="right">5</td></tr>
<tr><td>10-12</td><td align="right">6</td></tr>
<tr><td>13-16</td><td align="right">7</td></tr>
<tr><td>17-20</td><td align="right">8</td></tr>
<tr><td>21+</td><td align="right">9</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The obscurity of a given topic should be determined by the GM. In some cases, this is equivalent to the rarity code found in <em>Creatures & Monsters</em> (e.g., <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Fauna_Lore">Fauna</a> and <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Flora_Lore">Flora Lore</a>) or in <em>Gamemaster Law</em> (e.g., <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Herb_Lore">Herb</a> and <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Poison_Lore">Poison Lore</a>). In other cases, the Gamemaster must decide on the obscurity rating, which will range from 1 (common knowledge) to 9 (arcane trivia). A character cannot attempt a Lore maneuver if the difficulty level plus obscurity rating exceeds twice the character's knowledge level. If the obscurity rating is not obvious, assume that it is equal to the difficulty level.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Asix, the scholar, has 7 ranks in <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Culture_Lore">Culture Lore</a>. The GM has determined that information about the gypsy nomads is somewhat scarce and assigns information concerning these people an obscurity of 6. Asix has a knowledge level of 5. He can therefore not attempt any maneuver more difficult than Medium. If he specialized in the nomads, he could attempt Hard maneuvers.
</blockquote>
<p>If the sum of the obscurity rating and difficulty level do not exceed the character's knowledge level, he can attempt the maneuver without any resources. Otherwise, the maneuver will require research. Most non-research maneuvers can be attempted in one round. If research is required, the maneuver will require a number of hours equal to the difficulty level times the obscurity rating.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Asix is not able to attempt any maneuver concerning the gypsies without doing some research. A Medium maneuver would take 24 hours of research. Better brew some coffee.
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="SoHK_5.9">5.9</a> Outdoor Skills</h2>
<p>Many Outdoor maneuvers must be resolved every strategic turn. Due to the variety of maneuvers in these categories, the GM must determine the amount of time required to complete a given maneuver. Many of the animal skills resemble skills in other categories, which can be referenced for guidelines.<br>If the maneuver involves an animal, the following modifiers apply:</p>

<h2><a name="SoHK_5.10">5.10</a> POWER SKILLS</h2><p>These skills all come from the following skill categories: Directed Spells, Power Awareness, Power Manipulation, Power Point Development, and Spells.<br>Most Power maneuvers require one minute to complete. For every round less than this devoted to the skill, the maneuver roll should be reduced by -20. This cannot be reduced to less than a single round (-100). This allows characters a desperate chance to attune to a new item while in combat.<br>Note that spell casting requires the expenditure of exhaustion points. Casting a spell drains one exhaustion point every two rounds. Concentration drains one exhaustion point every six rounds (one minute). If a character desires to maintain concentration for an extended time, he should develop the Meditation skill, which allows him to concentrate without spending exhaustion points.</p>
<h2><a name="SoHK_5.11">5.11</a> SCIENCE/ANALYTIC SKILLS</h2><p>The length of time required to complete a Science/ Analytic maneuver depends on the difficulty of the maneuver. Note that some maneuvers may take longer (e.g., <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Biochemistry">Biochemistry</a>) and others may take less time (e.g., <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Basic_Math">Basic Math</a>).</p>

</table>
<p>Use of a Science/Analytical skill assumes that the character has the necessary materials and tools to complete the maneuver. The cost of such materials can vary widely, and must be determined on a case-by-case basis. The quality of these tools may provide the scientists with a bonus or penalty range from -20 to +20.<br>
A Science/Analytic maneuver roll cannot be made until the task is completed. The scientist has no way of knowing how successful he will be until this time.</p>
<h2><a name="SoHK_5.12">5.12</a> SELF CONTROL SKILLS</h2><p>Self Control maneuvers are used to perform some feat that requires mind over matter or requires the character to summon internal energies to accomplish some task. Many of these maneuvers are physically draining. Nearly all Adrenal maneuvers require the character to spend 5 exhaustion points per round. This includes the round of preparation (20% action), thereby raising the total cost to 6 exhaustion points (1 the first round and 5 the next).</p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> GMs may allow characters to sustain Adrenal maneuvers. The exhaustion point cost increases by a factor o f one for each round after the first, and there is a cumulativepenalty of-10 to the Self Control maneuver roll after the first.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> En-Shin, the <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior Monk</a>, spends the first round of combat preparing for <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Adrenal_Speed">Adrenal Speed</a> (20% action, 1 exhaustion point). His maneuver is successful, so the next round he receives 200% activity (and spends 5 exhaustion points). He spends 20% of that round preparing for another <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html3Adrenal_Speed">Adrenal Speed</a> maneuver. This attempt will be made at -10. It is successful, so the next round En-Shin spends 10 exhaustion points to maintain the <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html3Adrenal_Speed">Adrenal Speed</a>. After 4 rounds of <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html3Adrenal_Speed">Adrenal Speed</a> (requiring a total of 51 exhaustion points, not including those spent attacking or maneuvering), En-Shin attempts to maintain <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html3Adrenal_Speed">Adrenal Speed</a> one more round. This attempt (at -40) fails, so En-Shin does not receive the benefits of <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html3Adrenal_Speed">Adrenal Speed</a> the following round. (Neither does he spend 25 more exhaustion points).</blockquote>
<p>Note that only Adrenal maneuvers and <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Frenzy">Frenzy</a> require the expenditure of exhaustion points. No other Self Control skills require exhaustion points. In fact, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Meditation">Meditation</a> can be used to prevent the loss of exhaustion points due to concentrating on a spell.</p>
<h2><a name="SoHK_5.13">5.13</a> SUBTERFUGE SKILLS</h2><p>Subterfuge skills are generally used to prevent others from noticing some misdeed. The difficulty of such a maneuver should not depend on the skill of potential observers. The difficulty of Subterfuge maneuvers depends only on the nature of the maneuver itself. In addition, lighting conditions thwart vision, they do not make Subterfuge maneuvers more simple. In fact, it might be quite difficult to find a hiding place in the dark, but harder still to find the person hiding.<br>Whenever a Subterfuge maneuver is made, the GM should note the level of success attained by the character (e.g., Partial Success, Success, Failure, etc.). Intentional attempts to discover the Subterfuge maneuver (using an <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Awareness_Searching">Awareness &bull; Searching</a> skill) requires a maneuver roll at least as successful as the Subterfuge maneuver. For example, if a thief attempted a Stealth maneuver and got a 159 (Success), an observer needs to roll a 111-175 (Success) to discover the hiding person. If the observer's result is a Partial Success or better, the observer might become suspicious even if the hiding person was not located.<br>If the observer is relying on unconscious Awareness skills (<a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Awareness_Senses">Awareness &bull; Senses</a> or <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Alertness">Alertness</a>), his result must exceed that of the hiding person. In the above example, the observer would need a 176 or better (Absolute Success) to locate the hiding person. If the maneuver result is equal to that of the Subterfuge maneuver, and the Awareness maneuver is a Partial Success or better, the observer might become suspicious.<br><a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Subterfuge_Stealth">Subterfuge &bull; Stealth</a> and <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Subterfuge_Attack">Subterfuge &bull; Attack</a> maneuver rolls are required every round. These tasks take at most a single round, and occasionally less. <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Subterfuge_Mechanics">Subterfuge &bull; Mechanics</a> maneuvers generally take one round times the difficulty level, squared. Notable exceptions include <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Forgery">Forgery</a> and <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Trap_Building">Trap Building</a>, which take longer.</p>
<h2><a name="SoHK_5.14">5.14</a> TECHNICAL/TRADE SKILLS</h2><p>The Technical/Trade categories encompass a large number of skills. The amount of time required to complete such a maneuver can vary widely, and must be determined on a case by case basis. Note that if tools are required, it is assumed the character has access to the necessary implements. If not, an additional penalty of at least -50 should be assessed.</p>
<h2><a name="SoHK_5.15">5.15</a> URBAN SKILLS</h2><p>These skills allow characters to assimilate into an urban setting, or locate a specific person or item. Assimilation maneuvers are attempted immediately upon entering the urban setting, or whenever it is important that the character blend in. It is not necessary to spend time performing these maneuvers, they occur automatically. Note that an assimilation maneuver can only be used to draw attention away from oneself. If the police are conducting door-to-door searches, you will need to use a Subterfuge skill to escape.<br>Locating people and items can take time. It generally takes one hour times the difficulty level, squared, of the maneuver to determine if the person or item exists in the area.<br>A character can designate one area within a city as an automatic specialization in all Urban skills. This assumes that the characterlives in this neighborhood and spends a considerable amount of time there. Assimilation maneuvers in this neighborhood automatically succeed, unless the character is performing some action that draws attention to himself. If the character moves, this specialization will disappear after one month. A new specialization will be gained for his new neighborhood after living there one month. If the character does not settle down, he will not have any automatic specialization until one month after he does settle down.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for in-air maneuvers (e.g., flying or levitation) or swinging on objects. This skill includes the use of parallel bars, uneven bars, and other gymnastic activities in which the majority of the activity is spent in airborne maneuvers. A successful maneuver roll can reduce the severity of a falling critical by one (i.e., a 'B' becomes an 'A', a 'D' becomes a 'C', etc.).</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>The primary goal of an Acrobatics maneuver is thesuccessful (safe) completion of an in-air maneuver. Unlike <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Flying/Gliding">Flying/Gliding</a>, the maneuver is linear; the acrobat cannot change direction while in the air. Whereas Acrobatics maneuvers tend to be graceful and beautiful, if beauty is the goal, an artistic skill (like <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Dance">Dance</a>) might be more appropriate.<br>
The difficulty of an Acrobatics maneuver is determined by the amount of movement the acrobat must perform, combined with the timing of the maneuver. Simply swinging on a rope is not difficult, but in order to grab the hands of another acrobat while swinging requires careful timing. Rotations and somersaults make the maneuver even more difficult.</p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> Every 180&deg; of rotation (in any direction) while performing an Acrobatics maneuver adds one to the difficulty. For example, a complete somersault (360&deg;) combined with a half spin (180&deg;) would add three difficulty levels.</blockquote>
<h4>Specialties</h4>
<ul>
<li>A specific gymnastic event (parallel bars, uneven bars, etc.).</li>
<li>Chandeliers, curtains, whips, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example Difficulties</h4>
<p><strong>Routine:</strong> Holding onto a swinging object (e.g., a rope). Partial Success requires a second roll to determine whether or not the character has lost his grip.</p><p><strong>Easy:</strong> Swinging across a pit or other opening provided the rope is already in hand. Again, Partial Success requires another roll.</p><p><strong>Light:</strong> A swing to a specific location. Partial Success indicates that the swing was successful, but misses the intended location by a similar percentage. (For example, Glimglad wants to swing from one balcony, across the room to the top of a staircase (a total of 50'). The result of the Light maneuver is a 70. Glimglad misses his intended location by 15' (30 percent). The Gamemaster decides that Glimglad has instead landed on the banister fifteen feet down the stairs.)</p><p><strong>Medium:</strong> A swing onto or into a combatant. A successful result forces the victim to make a RR (level vs. number of ranks of Acrobatics) or take an Unbalancing critical (1 severity/20 faIlure). If the acrobat lands on the victim, the victim resists at a -20, but the acrobat falls if the victim makes the RR. This is a Very Hard maneuver if the acrobat has a weapon or other object in one hand.</p><p><strong>Hard:</strong> Riding a curtain or a sail with a knife. Partial Success indicates the acrobat falls more quickly than intended and may take falling damage. (For example, E'Rollleaps out of a crow's nest and attempts to use the sail to brake his fall. He rolls and gets a 30. Since the crow's nest was 50' high, E'Roll takes damage for a 35' fall. Ouch!)<br>
Catching a static object while falling and swinging around it before dropping further. (This is frequently done in comic books.) This maneuver is modified by -1 for every 10' fallen, but will reduce the severity of a falling critical by one. This is an extremely hard maneuver if the object being caught is in motion (e.g., a trapeze). Note that if there are several objects to brake the fall, the acrobat can reduce the critical several times, thereby eliminating the critical(s) entirely.</p><p><strong>Very Hard:</strong> Swinging from rope to rope, vine to vine, etc. Partial Success indicates that the acrobat covers less than the normal distance. If one rope must be released prior to grasping the next, the maneuver becomes more difficult and all Partial Successes must be rolled again to avoid falling.</p><p><strong>Extremely Hard:</strong> 1'-10' between ropes. </p>
<p><strong>Sheer Folly:</strong> 11'-25' between ropes. </p>
<p><strong>Absurd:</strong> 26'-50' between ropes.</p> <!-- AppleSegEnd -->

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for simulating actions or reactions of others, as often used in drama performances, devising new identities, etc. This skill may be used to impersonate others, or hide one's own reactions from others. It may be used anytime a character wishes to behave or appear in a manner other than normal and natural to him under any given circumstances.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>The goal of acting is the creation of a (fake) persona that facilitates the viewer's suspension of disbelief. The more complex or fantastic the persona, the more difficult the attempt. If the skill roll is successful, the actor has convincingly portrayed the persona he is acting. (This may result in nothing more than a laugh or tear, depending on the difficulty of the maneuver.)<br>It is relatively simple to remove a specific component of one's own demeanor; it is much more difficult to portray a believable character replete with idiosyncrasies and intricate emotions. Humor is also easier to portray, since plausibility is not a factor.<br>When attempting to fool a target, the target may be entitled to an <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Alertness">Alertness</a> roll.</p>
<h4>Specialties</h4>
<ul>
<li>Comedy, Tragedy, etc.</li>
<li>A specific individual, race or character.</li>
<li>A specific emotion or characteristic.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example Difficulties</h4>
<p><strong>Routine:</strong> Hiding a specific brief response. Success indicates that the actor has replaced his natural response with one chosen by him. This is particularly useful when receiving Winter Solstice gifts from great aunts and uncles.</p><p><strong>Easy:</strong> Hiding one characteristic trait for an extended period of time. Each time the characteristic trait would have been exhibited, the actor makes a roll to hide it. Each consecutive Partial Success increases the chance of detection by +10. Any Absolute Success reduces the chance of detection by -10 until a failure is rolled.</p><p><strong>Light:</strong> Adding one characteristic trait for an extended period of time. Each time the characteristic trait is exhibited, the actor makes a roll. See above for modifiers. (For example, an evil Doppelganger is pretending that he worships the Lord of Light. Every week he must roll while attending mass to convince his companions that he is devout.)</p><p><strong>Medium:</strong> Portraying a simple character. The character has no emotional depth and is plausible only for a short time. Most minor theatrical roles fall into this category.</p><p><strong>Hard:</strong> Portraying a specific individual to an audience or target who has only heard of the individual. (For example, the evil Doppelganger has assassinated the ambassador of Sherib while en route to Salin. The ambassador has never been to Salin, but has a definite reputation.)</p><p><strong>Very Hard:</strong> Portraying a complex character. The character has real emotional depth and is plausible for an extended time. Most main and supporting roles fall into this category.</p><p><strong>Extremely Hard:</strong> Portraying a specific individual to an audience or target who is familiar with the individual, but not a close friend or family member. The actor could, for example, portray the king at official functions to thwart assassination attempts.Portraying a complex character whose ethos is antithetical to that of the actor's. Many actors simply refuse such roles, due to the difficulty of the task.</p><p><strong>Sheer Folly:</strong> Portraying a specific individual to that individual's close family and friends. Note that this implies that the individual has spent a great deal of time with the target. A person's own wife may not know her husband if he is always at war (but the generals would certainly recognize an impostor immediately).</p>
<p><strong>Absurd:</strong> Portraying a specific individual whose ethos is antithetical to that of the actor's. Any attempt to fool magical detection would also fall into this category.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for functioning successfully within a familiar government where record keeping, personnel interaction, and bureaucracy are present. Also useful in gaining public office and applying governmental power.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>The goal of Administration is the successful application of political influence, graft, and legal loopholes towards some specific goal. That goal must be within the means of the local governmental system. Thus, gaining office and changing a law may be possible goals. However, if only the king can declare war, an Influence skill should be used to persuade the king. (Although gaining an audience will probably require an Administration roll.)

This may be modified by up to two degrees of difficulty by the evidence available and by the public perception of the individual.

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill enhances the ability of the character to maintain his balance in one maneuver action (requiring balance).

<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>This skill provides an additional bonus to maneuvers that involve balance. Unless this skill is followed by such a maneuver it is useless.

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for achieving a special +25 bonus on any activity attempted using concentration and the focusing of internal reserves. If the user makes a successful static maneuver, +25 is added to any such activity the next round. However, this static maneuver requires 75% activity the round it is attempted.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>This skill provides an additional bonus to moving maneuvers, attacks and Adrenal skills. (Static maneuvers are modified by meditation.) This skill is modified by how strongly the character feels about the successful completion of the action. Life-long goals should be realized once during the life-time of the character. Major goals are realized after several adventures. Minor goals should be realized at most once per adventure.<br>This skill is also easier during cinematic high points. Thus, the usefulness of Adrenal Concentration is dependent on the storyline as determined by the GM. There can be multiple climaxes during a single adventure, but only a single scene involving plot resolution.

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>With a successful static maneuver, a character may decrease the severity of a fall by his skill rank bonus times one foot. For example, if a character's skill rank bonus was +60, a 100' fall would be treated as a 40' fall. The severity of a fall can never be reduced below that of a l' fall (requiring a roll of the Fall/Crush Attack Table with a +1 modification). A 20% activity is required the round after the fall (assuming he's alive and conscious). This is the "recuperation" round (ExP cost is 1 during the recuperation round).</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>This skill reduces the damage taken from falling. This skill does not assume that the character has any means by which to slow his descent (unlike <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Acrobatics">Acrobatics</a>). It can be used in conjunction with <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Acrobatics">Acrobatics</a>, but a +1 Fall/ Crush attack must be made regardless.

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for keeping oneself alive after being injured. This skill puts the character's body into a near death condition (coma) for 1 day/round before death. (Rounds before death is obtained from the description of the critical strike taken.) Due to the slowing down of the character's body's metabolic rate, he will appear dead to all but the closest of scrutiny (-75 to other characters' Awareness maneuvers).<br>If the character fails to make a successful static maneuver, he immediately goes into a coma but you still die at the appointed time. He may be awakened from this state by one or more of the following: Within 1 hour of the preset time, an <dfn>Awaken</dfn> spell, or vigorous physical disturbance lasting more than 3 minutes. If the character receives a critical that kills instantly, this skill will have no effect.<br>Certain types of damage may make it impossible to use this skill (e.g., massive brain damage, head being completely ripped off or destroyed, body dissolving in acid, heart being ripped out of chest, etc.).

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill gives a character a +10 modification on his melee OB and doubles the number of concussion hits that he delivers from melee attacks. This skill requires taking a 20% activity action in a "preparation round" immediately prior to the use of this skill (ExP cost is 1 during the preparation round). Alternatively, this skill can be used to increase the character's Strength stat bonus by +5 for the purpose of one maneuver.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>This skill is modified by how strongly the character feels about the successful completion of the action. Life-long goals should be realized once during the life-time of the character. Major goals are realized after several adventures. Minor goals should be realized at most once per adventure.<br>This skill is also easier during cinematic high points. Thus, the usefulness of Adrenal Strength is dependent on the storyline as determined by the GM. There can be multiple climaxes during a single adventure, but only a single scene involving plot resolution. The GM may rule that during some scenes Adrenal Strength is practically useless (e.g., when the plot demands the failure of the characters in some endeavor). These scenes should be used sparingly.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>By using this skill, the individual may toughen his body to withstand blows that would otherwise inflict damage. This skill requires taking a 20% activity action in the round immediately prior to the use of this skill or during the snap action phase of the same round (ExP cost is 1 during the preparation round). Then, the character must make a static maneuver modified by this skill bonus. If successful, the individual may reduce the severity of any critical that he receives by one (i.e., an 'E' becomes a 'D', a 'B' becomes an 'A', etc.) during the next round (or remainder of the current round). In addition, any self-inflicted critical stemming from the individual striking a surface or object is nullified completely (e.g., no Krush critical would be sustained from attempting to break a brick with one's hand).</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for using higher levels of mathematics (e.g., calculus, differential equations, basic relativity, etc.). You must develop a higher skill rank in <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Basic_Math">Basic Mathematics</a> (e.g., if your rank in <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Basic_Math">Basic Math</a> is 12 you may only develop this skill to 11 skill ranks).</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>The goal of this skill is the correct application of mathematical theory to an actual problem. Such a problem may originate from physics, magical inquiry, encryption, etc. The mathematician applies the tools and tricks of mathematics to convert the complex into the mundane. Difficult problems are broken down into several easier problems until each sub-problem is trivial.<br>In a medieval setting, mathematics and physics were wholly intertwined. In a fantasy setting, mathematics and magic can also easily be intertwined. (Read any Jack Chalker novel as an example.) In any event, however, mathematics is rarely pursued for the sake of mathematics. In most cases, the mathematical solution must be converted to a real solution. (For example, a mathematician can calculate a parabolic trajectory, but a siege engineer is needed to shoot a catapult.)</p>
<blockquote id="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> If a successful Advance Math maneuver is requiredfor a subsequent maneuver, the GM may want to double the skill bonus provided by Advanced Math for the subsequent maneuver. See <a href="#SoHK_2.5">Section 2.5</a> for more details.

<h4>Specialties</h4>
<ul>
<li>Calculus, physics, probability, algebra, etc.</li>
<li>Any specific application.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example Difficulties</h4>
<p><strong>Routine:</strong> Calculating a limit. Limits allow mathematicians to study the behavior of a function at a specific value, without actually reaching that value. If the laws of magic are governed by the principles of mathematics, then the successful application of the limit may allow a magical researcher to perform research more safely (e.g., study the effects of fire by getting very close to the flame, but not entering).</p><p><strong>Easy:</strong> Calculating a linear derivative. Derivatives are important in calculating the effects of gravity on an object, or in any parabolic trajectory. Derivatives also measure rates of change (acceleration, growth, etc.) and help in identifying maximums and minimums.<br>A successful application of the derivative may alIow a mathematician to identify a maximally (or minimally) disruptive social change. The derivative is also crucial to siege engineering.</p><p><strong>Light:</strong> Calculating basic probabilities. Basic probability is important to gamblers and experimenters alike. The basic laws of probability allow the mathematician to deal with results that are not mutually exclusive, and provide him with powerful counting methods. These tools allow the mathematician to predict distributions and likely outcomes.<br>For example, after careful research, a mathematician could use the laws of probability to determine how long (on average) it takes for a magic item to recharge. In addition, he can calculate how likely it is for the recharging process to take twice as long (as normal). Probability is also the basis for every casino.</p><p><strong>Medium:</strong> Calculating an integral. The integral is the opposite of the derivative; their uses are similar. The integral can be used to calculate the area or volume of an irregular object. When the integral is applied to multiple dimensions, the effects of torque and torsion can be understood. The integral measures cumulative effects over time (force, growth, etc.) and helps to identify balance points.</p>
<p><strong>Hard:</strong> Calculating advanced statistics/probabilities. Advanced probability is important largely to experimenters. Using the techniques of advanced statistics, a mathematician can determine not only the average and extreme behavior of a model (or event), but also the probability of his answers being correct. In addition, these methods allow a mathematician to combine several people's work and merge the results into a single result (which will necessarily be more accurate than each individual result).<br>Advanced statistics can be used to study the effects of social policy on behavior. These results can then help modify the behavior of a population (although the number of variables should put the mathematician at a severe penalty).</p><p><strong>Very Hard:</strong> Calculating differential equations. These equations are sophisticated applications of the integral and derivative. Differential equations allow the rate of change to depend on the rate of change as well as time (e.g., population growth increases as time progresses, but decreases as population growth increases). These conundrums can only be solved with a differential equation.<br>Problems that involve differential equations are common in architecture and dynamic physical structures (complex machines rather than simple machines).</p><p><strong>Extremely Hard:</strong> The successful application of the integral may help the mathematician determine the cumulative effects of casting Calculations in any branch of mathematics that has not yet been discovered. Examples (in a fantasy setting) might be applying the same spell multiple times on the same target. The integral is particularly crucial to most physics applications including quantum mechanics, relativity, etc.</p><p><strong>Sheer Folly:</strong> Applying any mathematics techniques (Medium or easier) to a dimension/plane with different laws of nature, or rules of mathematics.</p><p><strong>Absurd:</strong> Applying any mathematics techniques (Hard or worse) to a dimension/plane with different laws of nature, or rules of mathematics.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for successfully marketing a product or service. Must be developed separately for each culture encountered.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>The goal of advertising is the successful sale of products and/or services to the general public. Mercenary companies use the skill to find employers. Craftsmen use the skill to find buyers.<br>Advertising is most useful in large towns or cities; the number of potential buyers is larger. It is also more useful when the goods or services being offered are useful and inexpensive.<br>There are two main uses for advertising:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The sale of large numbers of goods to the mass market. Since bargaining may not be involved, Trading may not be appropriate, but Advertising can be used to encourage sales.</p></li>
<li><p>The location of employers or employees. An advertising roll determines the number of such persons, relative to the number available.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In general, 10% of all possible buyers/employees/employers can be contacted with a successful skill roll. Partial Success yields 2%, Near Success 8%, Absolute Success 13%, and Unusual Event 20%. (If there are competitors in the market, successful advertising increases market share by one percentage point.)<br>Note that the number of potential buyers is based on the number of people exposed to the advertisements who may be interested in purchasing the advertised product. It is not possible to sell rune paper to the common person; it would make more sense to advertise in the Mage's Guild than on the street.<br>The following examples assume that the product is either a consumable or is useful on a daily basis. For employment, it assumes a contract for at least one year, or a single assignment. Each step longer (for products) or shorter (for services) increases the difficulty by one. The steps are: Hour, Day, Week, Month, Year, Decade.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for identifying and mixing various non-magical substances with relatively predictable results. Acids, itching powders, toxins, etc. are just a few of the possible results. The GM may deem some combinations inappropriate for his world (e.g., he might disallow gunpowder or petroleum products). This skill allows the user to know elemental composition, reactions, compounds, etc. Skill is modified from -30 to -70 for lack of laboratory equipment, supplies, etc.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>The creation or idetification of an alchemical compound is the alchemist's goal. The more general the results, the easier it is to create or identify a given compound. It is more difficult to invent a new compound than it is to recreate an existing one. For example, there are many acids capable of devouring most metals that can be stored in glass. It is more difficult to design an acid that destroys only steel, but leaves iron untouched, or to design an agent that causes steel to revert to iron.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for unconscious observation and assimilation of information from the general environment. The GM should use this skill to allow characters a chance to notice objects, events, and other phenomena around them. Note that use of this skill assumes that the character has not indicated that he is looking for such a thing. If the player is actively seeking something within the environment, the appropriate <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Awareness_Searching">Awareness &bull; Searching</a> skill should be used.<br>The existence of this as an acquirable skill indicates one's ability to train one's level of sensitivity to such things, but more active observation should be handled by the skills of <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Observation">Observation</a> and <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Situational_Awareness">Situational Awareness</a>.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>This skill functions like any of the <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Awareness_Searching">Awareness &bull; Searching</a> skills, but on an unconscious basis. As a result, it provides characters with profession bonuses in Awareness or with high Intuition bonuses to become quite good at all of the <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Awareness_Searching">Awareness &bull; Searching</a> skills by developing this skill. It is strongly recommended that the difficulty of the Awareness maneuver be made more difficult when using Alertness as follows:<br>Subtract the number of ranks of the relevant <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Awareness_Searching">Awareness &bull; Searching</a> skill from the number of ranks of Alertness.</p><table summary="" >

<tr><td>Optional Stats Used:</td><td align="right">Ag/SD/In</td></tr>
</table>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill is the ability to make a very precise attack. To use his Ambush skill a character must approach his foe undetected and be able to strike before the foe can react. At this point, the character must declare whether he is striking to kill or subdue. An attack is then made normally, and an Ambush static maneuver is made (0% activity) and modified by position, target's <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Sense_Ambush">Sense Ambush</a> (a change from <em>RMFRP</em>), and other factors (e.g., position, lighting, etc.).<br>
If the Ambush static maneuver is successful, the character may modify his result on the resulting critical strike roll (using the normal <em>Arms Law</em> Critical Strike Table if the intent was to kill, or the Subdual Critical Strike Table if the intent was to subdue). This modification consists of being allowed to adjust the critical strike roll by any number up to the Ambush skill rank (not bonus) of the attacker. This adjustment may be either up or down. Note that to use this bonus, the attacker must first get a normal critical strike result on an attack table. If he does, however, this ability greatly increases the chance of a killing or incapacitating blow and tremendously increases the chance of a result that takes effect instantly.<br>Since position is relatively unpredictable in a general melee situation, Ambush skill is halved if an ambushed foe is in a melee situation. (Note: The character must still approach the foe undetected and strike before he can react.)<br>If a "Large" or "Super Large" creature is ambushed, the ambushing character·may not declare a strike to subdue, and the Ambush skill rank is added to the critical roll. If the resulting modified roll is above 95, a second roll is made and added to the modified critical as in a normal open-ended roll.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>The difficulty of an ambush maneuver is dependent on two factors. Small, blunt objects are the most useful when attempting to subdue. Small, sharp objects are the most useful when attempting to kill. In addition, the ambusher needs access to the target's head (or other weak point).<br>
For each difference in size, the difficulty level is increased by one. For example, a <a href="../en.lproj/races.html#Halfling">Halfling</a> is attempting to ambush a large <a href="../en.lproj/races.html#Ogre">Ogre</a>. Since the <a href="../en.lproj/races.html#Ogre">Ogre</a> is two sizes larger, the maneuver is increased by two levels of difficulty.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>The animal handler's primary concern is the well-being of the animal(s) in his care. Over the course of time, poor treatment, malnutrition, etc. will lead to the deterioration of the animal. It is the animal handler's responsibility to prevent this from happening. Any (non-herd) domestic animal that is not cared for properly at least once each week may suffer as a result. Each week there is a 5% (cumulative) chance that some malady will afflict the animal. In addition, each month without care will result in the deterioration of the animal's stats (1d10 from each stat). Note: this assumes that the animal has a ready supply of food and water.<br>One successful Animal Handling maneuver each week (one attempt per day) will prevent the animal from suffering any penalties. A failed skill roll will not cause damage, but it may annoy the creature (all maneuvers with that animal for the next 24 hours are at -10).

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for simple communicating wtih, and (if possible) the mastering of an animal. This skill must be developed separately for each different type of animal.

<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>his skill has two main uses. The animal master can attempt to establish communication with the creature. This does not imply any attempt to coerce the animal into performing any action. It merely allows the human and animal to communicate as if each had 1-4 ranks of the other's language. Note that most animals are incapable of duplicity.<br>The animal master may also desire to control the animal's behavior. In this case, the difficulty of the maneuver is dependent on the natural tendencies/behaviors of the animal (see <em>Creatures & Monsters</em>). The difficulty level should be increased if the animal is not familiar with the action requested by the animal master, or if the action is contrary to the animal's demeanor (e.g., convincing a rabbit to attack a wolf).</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for training a particular type of animal, such as birds of prey, dogs, bears, big cats, etc. Skill normally results in the taming of the animal. This skill must be developed separately for each different type of animal.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>This skill can be used to tame an animal, i.e., it will accept the presence of a human. If the animal is naturally aggressive, it will not attack unless provoked. The difficulty of this maneuver is two levels easier than an <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Animal_Mastery">Animal Mastery</a> maneuver on a similar animal.<br>Once tame, a tame animal can be taught tricks and commands. The difficulty of this maneuver is based on the complexity of the trick to be mastered (from the animal's perspective) and the number of tricks already known. Each trick or command after the first has a cumulative -1 penalty. (For example, Rarl desires to train her great cat another command, drop it. The cat already knows attack, fetch, come, stay and protect. Hence, this training maneuver will be at -5.) Most animals are intelligent enough to understand multiple commands that are strung together to produce new commands.<br>Note that in many cases, the animal will need to make a maneuver roll to perform the requested maneuver successfully.</p>
<h4>Specialties</h4>
<ul>
<li>Any individual animal.</li><li>Any specific command.</li>
<li>Taming.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example Difficulties</h4>
<p><strong>Routine:</strong> Teaching an animal to use a litter box.</p><p><strong>Easy:</strong> Training a horse or other riding animal to allow it to be ridden.</p><p><strong>Light:</strong> Taming a "docile" or "passive" animal. Teaching an animal to heel, or obey simple directions (forward, left, right, stop, etc.).</p><p><strong>Medium:</strong> Taming a "normal," "hungry," or "inquisitive" animal. Teaching a predatory animal to attack on command. Teaching an animal to vary its pace (trot, gallop, walk, etc.). Teaching an animal instinctual commands (e.g., training a bloodhound to follow a scent).</p><p><strong>Hard:</strong> Taming an "aggressive," "jumpy," or "protective" animal. Teaching an animal complex directions (jump, twist, etc.). Teaching an animal non-instinctual commands (play dead, roll over, beg, etc.).</p><p><strong>Very Hard:</strong> Taming a "belligerent," "hostile," or "timid" animal. Teaching a horse or other riding animal not to bolt when its rider vaults into the saddle. Teaching a non-aggressive animal to attack on command.</p><p><strong>Extremely Hard:</strong> Taming any other animal. Training an animal not to flee upon encountering a dangerous or hostile situation. (A horse cannot be considered a warhorse until it learns this.)</p><p><strong>Sheer Folly:</strong> Training an animal to operate independently within simple predefined parameters. (Most search and rescue dogs fall into this category.)</p><p><strong>Absurd:</strong> Training an animal to operate independently within complex predefined parameters. This effectively raises the animal's intelligence one category.</p><!-- AppleSegEnd -->

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides knowledge of linguistic trends, customs, habits and cultural trends of any known races and cultures. Skill may be developed for any specific race or culture from the character's home world. Several different anthropology races or cultures may be developed simultaneously, assuming research materials are available.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>Anthropology allows a character to identify the customs and trends of a culture based on either archeological remains, or prior experience. As a general rule, an anthropologist is familiar with one race for every rank of this skill. This skill studies extinct cultures and peoples. The study of living cultures is <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Culture_Lore">Culture Lore</a> (or <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Influence">Influence</a> skills).<br>
The difficulty of this skill is dependent on the amount of information that has survived to the present day. The more infrequently a given practice was performed, the less information there will be. Many natural disasters will destroy or obscure archaeological information, but some (e.g., ash eruptions) may preserve the remains for an extended time.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for determining or estimating the value of an object or goods other than armor, metal, stones, or weapons.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>The goal of the appraiser is the accurate determination of an item's value. This is a relatively simple task when the object is commonly available and therefore subject to standard market forces. It is more difficult to appraise art, collections, and other rare objects.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>The architect's ultimate goal is the design of a building that is both aesthetically pleasing as well as sound. Towards this end, an architect must have some mathematical training.

<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>Each armor type has a Moving Maneuver Penalty (MMP) associated with it for untrained individuals. This penalty modifies Moving Maneuver rolls. The different armor types are divided into five groups based upon the composition of the armor: type 1-4 = No Armor; types 5-8 = Soft Leather; types 9-12 = Rigid Leather; types 13-16 = Chain; and types 17-20 = Plate. There are no Moving Maneuver Penalties associated with No Armor, and therefore there is no need to apply skill ranks towards it.<br>The Soft and Rigid Leather skills are both found in the <a href="skillcat.html#Armor_Light">Light Armor Skill Category</a>; Chain is found in the <a href="skillcat.html#Armor_Medium">Medium Armor Skill Category</a>; Plate is found in the <a href="skillcat.html#Armor_Heavy">Heavy Armor Skill Category</a>.<br>Every encumbering armor has a minimum maneuver penalty associated with it. The skill bonus for maneuvering for a group of armor types reduces the maximum penalty for maneuvering until the minimum maneuver penalty is reached. This limit represents the fact that weight and constriction of the armor will always hinder the character to some extent. These minimums may vary for certain superior or magical suits of armor.<br>In addition, each armor type has a Quickness penalty associated with it.<br>An Armor Quickness penalty can reduce or cancel a combatant's Quickness stat bonus for his DB (see <a href="5800.html#RMFRP_8.4"><em>RMFRP</em></a>). It will not reduce a combatant's overall DB below the level that it would be at with a zero Quickness stat bonus.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>The GM may require the character to make maneuver rolls for various activities in combat. The most common examples are standing up and dropping to the ground.<br>
It should be difficult to injure oneself by standing. It merely takes time. Conversely, a drop or dive is always successful, but the character may be injured in the process (+0 Fall).</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for recognizing and knowing the powers of potent magical items.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>This skill provides characters (and players) with information about magic items they encounter or with which they are familiar. This skill is only useful if some source of information exists about the item in question. This may include legends, bardic recitations, word of mouth, reputation, etc. The potency of magic items that can be identified with this skill is dependent on the amount of magic in the campaign. In a standard fantasy game, this skill can only identify those items that require an Alchemist of at least 11th level. The item must also have specific abilities (e.g., a scholar may recognize Celebtil, sword of the High Elves, but could not identify a +20 magical blade).

<p>This skill enables a character to use the spell abilities of a staff, wand, or any item with spell casting capabilities. In order to cast spells from an item, the wielder of the item must have made an Attunement static maneuver.<br>If an item has several spells or groups of spells that are widely separated in power or type, the GM may require separate Attunement static maneuvers for each spell or group of spells.<br>"Teaching" someone else an item is not permitted because using an item is a personal experience between the individual and the item. Although you may tell someone what the item does and thus remove any penalty for not knowing the spell(s) in the item, you cannot aid them. Certain spells on items do not normally require Attunement rolls, subject to GM stipulation. They include spells that operate constantly, bonuses built into items, and spells in intelligent items.<br>All of these cases include spells that do not require the conscious casting of any spell by the wielder of the item. A character should be given one chance to attune to an item. If he fails, he may not try again until he improves his skill rank with Attunement.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill allows understanding and analysis of basic biochemistry and genetics for the life forms of a specific area.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>The most common goal of biochemistry is breeding. The biochemist is interested in producing animals/plants that exhibit specific (desirable) traits. The result is generally considered to be a distinct sub-species (e.g., Labrador Retriever, German Shepherd, etc.).<br>In some cases, the biochemist may desire to create a hybrid creature, the result of mating animals/plants of two different species. The resulting offspring is usually sterile (unless the biochemist rolls an Absolute Success or unmodified 100).</p>
<h4>Specialties</h4>
<ul>
<li>Any specific species or trait.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example Difficulties</h4>
<p><strong>Routine:</strong> Breeding a pure member of a sub-species from pure parents.</p><p><strong>Easy:</strong> Generating a new strain of plant that is a modification of a current strain. For example, breeding an apple tree that produces smaller apples of the same variety.</p><p><strong>Light:</strong> Analyzing a family tree to determine the likelihood of an unborn child exhibiting specific traits.</p><p><strong>Medium:</strong> Generating a new sub-species that exhibits traits common to the creature. For example, breeding a longhaired housecat whose fur is generally black with white features.</p>
<p><strong>Hard:</strong> Determining a person's parents based on a pool of likely candidates.</p><p><strong>Very Hard:</strong> Generating a new sub-species that exhibits traits that are rarely exhibited by the creature, but do occur naturally. For example, breeding a horse that can instinctually walk backwards.</p><p><strong>Extremely Hard:</strong> Identifying if two creatures are genetically compatible (i.e., can produce viable offspring).</p><p><strong>Sheer Folly:</strong> Generating a new sub-species that exhibits one or more traits of a different species. For example, breeding a peach that has the rind of an orange.</p><p><strong>Absurd:</strong> Generating a new sub-species that combines two (or more) creatures into one. For example, breeding a winged horse. (The GM may require the biochemist to use magic to facilitate this combination.)</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for knowledge of water courses such as the location of sand bars, rapids, waterfalls, whirlpools, currents, reefs, icebergs, vegetation clogs (underwater snags and roots or overhead hanging branches and vines), etc. Skill is very useful for navigating water ways. Each water course must be learned separately.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>The Boat Pilot skill allows a character to determine if a particular vessel can navigate a given water course and how,to navigate that course most efficiently. In general, the smaller the vessel is, the easier the maneuver. These examples also assume that boats are used for river travel and ships for ocean travel. If this is not the case, the maneuvers should be made more difficult.</p>

<p><strong>Routine:</strong> Identifying the location of the most obvious hazards in a particular portion of a water course.</p><p><strong>Easy:</strong> Determining if a craft is capable of navigating a particular water course. This includes determining if the craft is too deep for the water, too wide to navigate the corners, or too small to avoid capsizing under the waves.

Partial and Near Successes indicate that the vessel survives the experience, but one or more crew members are lost in the attempt.</p><p><strong>Absurd:</strong> Piloting a boat over a waterfall. A successful skill roll indicates that the craft has found the safest path over the waterfall. This may still result in the destruction of the craft upon impact, but there will be minimal crew losses (0%-30% based on the circumstances).</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus to combat in which there is no organized melee (tavern brawls, riots, etc.). Targets are chosen on the basis of proximity and blows are exchanged in an essentially random fashion. This skill allows one to better handle oneself in such situations.<br>Sometimes a character will find himself in combat without a weapon. If it is a general melee situation (Le., combatants are using weapons designed to kill each other), such a character may make "Martial Arts" attacks. He may not use Brawling attacks in such a situation.<br>If such a combatant has a substantial object in his hands capable of blocking a weapon blow (e.g., a stool, a mattress, a log, a body), he may even be given a shield bonus for the item. In such a case, a GM may even allow the combatant to make a "club" attack.<br>In a similar manner, a combatant may "parry" with suitable terrain features (e.g., dodge around a tree, duck under a large branch, step behind a door). As always, the GM is the final judge as to the appropriateness of such "parrying" situations.<br>In a brawl (i.e., a general fracas, the combatants are not using killing weapons; e.g., a barroom brawl), an unarmed character can make Brawling attacks or Martial Arts attacks as he chooses.<br>If the character chooses to make Brawling attacks, the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#AL_T-3.3"><em>Arms Law</em> Brawling Attack Table 3.3</a> should be used with Brawling criticals.

At the GM's discretion, this may also allow the identification of bribable individuals; the GM may also allow the use of this skill to help in identifying persons likely to have been bribed by the evidence of some unusual behavior.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>he goal of bribery is the exchange of money (or some other form of payment) for political or legal influence. Bribery also implies that it is not legal to purchase the favors being requested. Legal transactions should use the <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Trading">Trading</a> skill.<br>The difficulty of a bribery maneuver is dependent on two key factors. First is the receptiveness of the target. The other is the risk involved for the person being bribed. If the favor requested is minor, the chance of discovery small, and the punishment minor, a bribery attempt is trivial. This skill is much easier in a society rife with corruption.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus in hiding or concealing an item or another person by using the natural attributes of the surrounding environment.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>Camouflage is used to prevent casual observers from noticing a person or object. It involves using disguise, coloring and natural obstructions to prevent the object from being seen. This skill will only prevent a casual observer from noticing the camouflaged item; a more rigorous search will almost always be successful. More comprehensive skill is gained from <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Hiding">Hiding</a> and <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Hide_Item">Hide Item</a>. Any <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Alertness">Alertness</a> or <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Awareness_Senses">Awareness &bull; Senses</a> maneuver made to detect a camouflaged object is 1-3 difficulty levels more difficult (depending on the success of the Camouflage maneuver).<br>Whereas this skill does not thwart a concerted search effort, it does allow the camouflager to hide objects of considerable proportions. It also allows the camouflager to hide other people, thereby making it more difficult for them to be seen (regardless of hiding ability).<br>Larger objects are more difficult to conceal. In addition, any object that calls attention to itself or is unusual in any way (e.g., a music box) is more difficult to conceal.</p>
<h4>Specialties</h4>
<ul>
<li>Any specific type of object, or any specific terrain.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example Difficulties</h4>
<p><strong>Routine:</strong> Camouflaging a tiny object, no larger than a small knife.</p><p><strong>Easy:</strong> Camouflaging a small object, no larger than a sword or military radio. Camouflaging a tiny creature (e.g., a mouse).</p><p><strong>Light:</strong> Camouflaging a man-sized object. Camouflaging a small creature (e.g., a dog).</p><p><strong>Medium:</strong> Camouflaging a person.

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus to the analysis, preparation and use of advanced maps and mapping techniques, using cartographic tools. This skill complements the skill of <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Navigation">Navigation</a>.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>Cartography is the art of creating an accurate and detailed map. Unlike mapping, this skill allows a character to generate a professional quality map. The distances will be accurate and to scale, altitude information may be included, contours drawn, etc. This skill is very timeintensive, but the result is a map that can be easily understood by others.<br>The difficulty of this skill is determined by the detail the cartographer wishes to add to the map. The larger the scale of the map, the more difficult the cartography maneuver (since large distances are harder to measure). To produce a map that includes information that is not purely geographic (e.g., a map of imports and exports) requires other appropriate knowledge.<br>Note that a successful skill roll indicates that the cartographer produced a map of average quality for the time period. In a medieval setting, the map may still have serious flaws.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>The Caving skill allows the spelunker to maneuver safely in caves and caverns. This includes identifying dangers, determining one's location, finding an exit, etc.<br>A maneuver should be made once for every cavern (and adjoining caves) while exploring. This maneuver should be made every 4 hours while traveling underground. A successful roll indicates that the inherent dangers of the area have been avoided and that the spelunker has not gotten lost. If the maneuver fails, the spelunker may become lost and/or injured. Partial Success and Near Success provide the spelunker with a chance to recover before becoming lost.

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This is the skill of transmitting power between two willing individuals over any distance, provided that contact can be made. The transmitter of the power must be able to see the receiver or know his exact location (direction and distance, or a specific place). The receiver must know exactly when the power is coming. For example, if a <a href="../en.lproj/professions..html#Cleric">Cleric</a> was at a certain altar at a certain time (midnight of full moon) ready to receive a spell, then another spell user (or deity) could use Channeling to send him a spell (if he knew where the altar was and the correct time). This could occur when a <a href="../en.lproj/professions..html#Cleric">Cleric</a> is on a vital mission and his god decides to aid him. Characters may channel to .each other.<br>It is important to note that the spells a "Channeling" spell user (e.g., <a href="../en.lproj/professions..html#Cleric">Clerics</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Animist">Animists</a>, etc.) acquires normally through worship and the use of intrinsic power points are not subject to this rule. Similarly, the development of the Channeling skill will not allow others to gain a "Channeling" spell user's intrinsic spell ability. This skill applies to extraordinary channeling.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>In an epic campaign, it is not unusual for gods to meddle in the affairs of mortals. If the GM allows it, characters can attempt to communicate with their deities directly. It is a Sheer Folly maneuver to contact one's deity and an Absurd maneuver to request a favor. In addition, there is a cumulative penalty of -100, every time after the first that a character requests a favor. This penalty decreases by 20 for every level the character gains after incurring the penalty. Hence, a character can request a favor once every five levels without any additional penalty.<br>For more details see the <em>Channeling Companion</em>.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for manipulating and using magical circles in conjunction with spells. It also allows a spell user to pursue non-magical research in defining and identifying new circles to add to his repertoire of spells.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>Circles are typically used to provide protection from Demons, spirits, or other ethereal beings. This skill allows a character to identify the circles produced by others (either magical or protective). A character may also be able to design and implement his own circles. If this is the case, the difficulty of the maneuver determines the maximum level of spirit that can be prevented from entering the circle. If the spirit's name is known, the protective circle will be more effective. If the GM is using other magical circles, the character may be able to glean more information from the circle.<br>If <em>Essence Companion</em> is being used, an essence spell-caster can produce a circle even if he doesn't know the spell being imbedded if he has studied another spell-caster's circle. A spell user automatically knows a number of circle spells equal to the number of ranks he has in Circle Lore squared. Additional circles must be encountered and studied.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for purification rituals to help remove outside energies and influences that linger on an object, item, person, etc. The use of this skill enables the user to rid himself of the touch of curses and hexes. Skill must be used within 5 minutes/rank of the Cleansing Trance skill in order to benefit the user at all. Otherwise the only way to be cleansed is from a spell or a person with a higher skill rank in Cleansing Trance. Physical prodding allows one to make a static maneuver to leave the trance, as does a painful strike (modify by +25).</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>A Cleansing Trance removes all traces of impure thoughts, transgressions and curses. It is used by holy people and spiritualists to keep their souls pure. The more serious the transgression or curse, the more difficult it is to regain inner harmony. Such inner peace is important to attain salvation or remain in the favor of one's deity.<br>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for climbing maneuvers over relatively short distances through the use of hand·holds, etc. This could range from the ability to climb sheer surfaces to climbing a ladder. Poorer hand-holds or greater speed will increase the difficulty of the maneuver. Note that extended climbs may require the use of the <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Scaling">Scaling</a> skill.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>There are two major factors that determine the difficulty of a Climbing maneuver: the grade (angle) of the climb and the frequency of hand-holds. This skill is strenuous, but allows rapid ascents.<br>Add one difficulty level if the surface is sandy, two if wet, three if oily and four if icy.</p><h4>Specialties</h4>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for locating individuals of influence or knowledge within an urban environment. It includes knowledge of where such individuals may be found as well as information involving how they might be reached (e.g., locating a crime boss or fence, politician, etc.). This skill is the equivalent of <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Scrounging">Scrounging</a> except that it operates for individuals or locations. Note that actual interaction with such persons are covered by the skills in the <a href="../en.lproj/skillcat.html#Influence">Influence</a> skill category.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>The results of this skill are obvious; either contact is made or not (although Absolute Failure might indicate that contact is made with someone who only claims to be influential). The difficulty of the maneuver is dependent on the amount of influence being sought and the risk involved in having the influence. (Most crime bosses are hard to contact because of the danger inherent to their status.) The size of the city does not modify the difficulty of the maneuver. There are fewer people in small villages, but there is less influence and people tend to know one another.</p><h4>Specialties</h4>
<ul>
<li>Any specific city.</li>
<li>Any specific type of influence (religious, political, criminal, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example Difficulties</h4>
<p><strong>Routine:</strong> Locating the city guard or other constabulary. Locating a minor church official, generally a lay person. This person cannot perform rites or blessings.</p><p><strong>Easy:</strong> Locating a petty official, someone who can process paperwork and little else. Locating a merchant that provides common services.</p><p><strong>Light:</strong> Locating a merchant that provides goods of above average quality.

Locating an official with enough influence to provide minor services (e.g., a permit, guild membership, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Hard:</strong> Locating a minor military official. Such a person has access to some confidential tactical information, but not to strategic information. Locating a major church official. This person has influence in religious decisions and may even have some spell-casting abilities.</p><p><strong>Very Hard:</strong> Locating a person willing to sell goods that are illegal, but can easily be smuggled.

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for manipulating one's body in order to move through small openings or absorb sudden crushing impact (other than falls). This skill also helps one escape from bonds, etc.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>There are three primary uses of this skill:<br>Absorbing an impact (such as a collision). This reduces the critical by one severity.Escaping from bonds.<br>
Squeezing through an opening. No maneuver is required if the opening is the same size as the character. For every 10% difference in a single dimension, the difficulty is increased by one. (For example, a 6' tall human is attempting to limbo under a pole that is 4' above the ground. This would be a Medium maneuver since the human must reduce his height by 31-40%.)</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for controlling one's lycanthropy. Note that this skill may only be developed by an individual already infected with an active form of lycanthropy. This skill may be used to prevent the onset of a lycanthropic change, to control one's bestial nature during such a change, or to initiate a change at will.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>Every time the moon rises or day breaks (or whatever trigger situation GM decides upon), a lycanthrope must make a transformation roll. A lycanthrope can also concentrate for 1 round and make a transformation roll. Any or all of the lycanthrope's Control Lycanthropy skill bonus can be added to or subtracted from a transformation roll. If the result is positive, the lycanthrope takes on (or remains in) human form. Otherwise, the lycanthrope takes on (or remains in) beast form.<br>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for creation of false but believable writings or illustrations or records from scratch. It is used to falsify bank records and accounts, change testimony records to misrepresent the facts, etc. Also includes the ability to simulate official documents, official currency (coined or paper moneys), stocks and bonds.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>The difficulty of a Counterfeiting maneuver is dependent largely on the amount of care that went into preventing someone from counterfeiting a particular document. Such techniques include water-marks, special dyes, intricate emblems, etc. Generally, the more important a document is, the harder it is to counterfeit. Money is particularly difficult to counterfeit since it is watched carefully. A counterfeiter must be careful not to pass too much bad money in a specific area, or the money will inevitably be discovered. The act of counterfeiting money was often considered to be treasonous, a capital offense.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for operating successfully in a complex, bureaucratic foreign environment, such as a foreign royal court or any other large foreign government structure. Tact, negotiation, and deceit are all facets o f diplomacy. It is used for the conducting of relations between nations. It is important to note that this skill provides a bonus for using the proper protocol in an unfamiliar situation and impressing a person in authority. This applies to situations ranging from an audience with the High King to an involuntary meeting with the Prince of Thieves. For operating within a familiar government system, refer to <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Administration">Administration</a>.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>This skill is used both to relate with foreign officials and governments and to manipulate them. It is often considered more civilized to settle a dispute with a war of words (diplomacy) than with an armed conflict. When attempting to manipulate a peer, many rounds of intense negotiations may be necessary. The game of give-and-take requires skill, tact and nerves of steel.<br>When attempting to relate within a foreign system, the difficulty of the maneuver depends on how different the system is from one's own. The difficulty of a manipulation maneuver depends on how much one is willing to give up.<br>When negotiating, each side should make a maneuver roll to determine how much the other side should give up. If both maneuvers are successful, and both sides agree, the negotiations are complete. If only one side is successful, they can declare the negotiations complete if they are satisfied with the results (or depart in disgusttheir position strengthened). If neither side was successful, the negotiations are a disaster. Both diplomats must swallow their ego in order to continue.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus in identifying and disarming, but not locating, an inanimate trap.</p><h4>Notes</h4>
<p>The difficulty of a Disarming Traps maneuver is dependent entirely on the complexity of the trap. Some traps can simply be triggered safely. Other traps may require an elaborate system of counter-balances. Once a trap has been discovered, it is usually fairly obvious how difficult it will be to disarm the trap (although some cruel trap designers may make it appear as if the trap is simpler to disarm than it is). If there is any doubt, an additional Detect Traps maneuver can be made to determine the complexity of the trap. Note that <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Detect_Traps">Detect Traps</a> may reveal the trigger, but not the trap itself. The victim may not know the level of danger he is facing.</p>
<h4>Specialties</h4>
<ul>
<li>Any specific type of trap.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example Difficulties</h4>
<p><strong>Routine:</strong> Triggering a trap safely. For example, turning a door knob without grabbing the portion of the knob in which a needle is hidden.</p><p><strong>Easy:</strong> The trap can be triggered and blocked or diverted in some way. For example, covering the hole out of which a dart flies.</p><p><strong>Light:</strong> Disarming a trap that you designed.</p><p><strong>Medium:</strong> Disarming the trap requires removing a counterweight. The trap's natural position is not activated. This often includes pit traps and rotating walls. Once the counter-weight is removed or disabled, the trap's components cannot move.</p><p><strong>Hard:</strong> Disarming a lever-based trap. For example, a pressure sensitive plate that causes a lever to move, activating the trap.</p><p><strong>Very Hard:</strong> Disarming the trap requires disabling a spring or other similar mechanism. Traps that propel darts or arrows are one example.</p><p><strong>Extremely Hard:</strong> Disarming the trap requires removing a trigger. Removal of a trigger usually causes the trap to be sprung, so the trigger must be disabled without activating the trap. The natural state of the trap is active (e.g., a bomb or gas capsule), the trigger prevents activation.</p><p><strong>Sheer Folly:</strong> Disarming the trap requires removing a trigger that is attached to another trigger such that one trap is triggered if the other is disabled. Both triggers must be disabled simultaneously.</p><p><strong>Absurd:</strong> Disarming the trap requires an elaborate collection of mirrors, pulleys, and/or counter-weight-such a trap is ridiculously complex and very volatile.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus to change one's appearance (not his actual shape or weight) by application of cosmetics and other props.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>This skill allows a character to appear to be someone he is not. In many cases, the disguise is intended to conceal one's own identity, but a skilled disguise artist can make someone appear to be a specific individual. Combined with Acting, this skill allows a character to assume a new identity. The difficulty of the maneuver is dependent on how radically one's appearance is being altered and how convincing the disguise must be.</p>
<h4>Specialties</h4>
<ul>
<li>Any specific type of disguise (e.g., monster, nobility, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example Difficulties</h4>
<p><strong>Routine:</strong> Adding a new facial characteristic that does not conceal one's identity in any way (e.g., a wart or beauty mark).</p><p><strong>Easy:</strong> Appearing to belong to a specific group of people (e.g., soldier, pirate, etc.). The character's identity is not changed (except that his friends might not expect to see him in such garb).</p><p><strong>Light:</strong> Partially appearing to be another type of creature/race. The disguise does not intend to fool the target/audience, only to portray key characteristics of the creature/race. For example, adding whiskers and white floppy ears in order to portray a rabbit.</p><p><strong>Medium:</strong> Completely altering one's identity so as to appear to be someone else. This might include adding facial hair, changing one's age, etc.</p><p><strong>Hard:</strong> Completely altering one's identity to that of a representative of a specific group of people (e.g., a sailor, noble, etc.). The disguise masks the character's actual identity.</p><p><strong>Very Hard:</strong> Designing a costume that convincingly alters a character's race or gender from a distance of 10' or more. Closer inspection may reveal certain flaws in the disguise.</p><p><strong>Extremely Hard:</strong> Assuming the identity of a specific individual whose appearance is vaguely familiar to the target/audience. This might include disguising oneself as a ruler in order to deliver a speech.</p>
<p><strong>Sheer Folly:</strong> Designing a costume that can convince a target/audience that the character is a specific individual whose appearance is very familiar to the target/audience. The disguise is good enough to pass all but the closest scrutiny.</p><p><strong>Absurd:</strong> Designing a costume that can convince a target/audience that the character is a monster of some sort even under close scrutiny.

<p>This skill provides a bonus for maintaining one's speed over long distances at slow to moderate paces, including pacing one's resources (exhaustion point expenditure) and running in a safe and non-injurious manner.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>This skill is used when maneuvering at a strategic level. It is not useful in tactical (round-by-round) situations. The base strategic movement rate is given in <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#RMFRP_T-5.2"><em>RMFRP</em> Table T-5.2</a>. A Distance Running maneuver is made when attempting to maneuver at paces faster than a walk, but slower than a sprint. (It is not possible to sprint for hours.) The base exhaustion rate for walking is 2 per hour; this assumes occasional rest stops. Thus, the base exhaustion rate for jogging is 4 per hour and the base rate for a run is 10 per hour. (Hence an average human can run for 4 hours and cover a distance of 20 miles, assuming he rolls quite well.)<br>The following modifiers apply:</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for foretelling the future or perceiving unknown quantities/qualities with the use of divinatory means and methods (e.g., crystal balls, tarot cards, sticks, tea leaves, gleefully rooting around in the steaming entrails of freshly dead animals...ahem... sorry...dice, palms, etc.). Each method must be learned separately. Skill can also be used to scan the past and present.</p><h4>Notes</h4>
<p>A successful Divination maneuver gives the diviner a symbolic representation of the future. The results are invariably vague and imprecise. The GM should study horoscopes, fortune cookies, or Nostradamus for inspiration. In general, it is important that the GM not reveal any specific information. (For example, it is not appropriate to tell the diviner that he will travel to Burnwood tomorrow. Rather, the GM might indicate that the diviner sees a journey in the near future. There are ashes and a branch present. In this way, if the players do not go to Burnwood, the GM can reinterpret the divination such that it comes true anyway. For more detail see <em>GM Law</em> and the <em>Mentalism Companion</em>.) The difficulty of the maneuver is based on the span of time to be divined. Note that the divination result need only relate to the span of time divined in some way. The events divined, may actually occur at any time; divination is an imprecise art at best.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for controlled falling maneuvers. This can range from controlling the direction of an extended fall to diving into water safely from a great height (up to 20'/skill rank if a successful maneuver roll is made or 30'/skill rank if the diver enters the water feet first).</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>The greatest challenge a diver faces, is performing his maneuver before his fall ends. The amount of time that one spends in the air is very short. A 15' fall takes a single second. In five seconds a person can fall hundreds of feet. The diver must complete his rotations in this span of time.<br>The difficulty of a diving maneuver is determined by the amount of movement the diver must perform. Additional complexity is introduced if the diver needs to control the direction of his fall in order to land at a specific point.</p>
<h4>Specialties</h4>
<ul>
<li>Diving into water, parachuting, diving onto vehicles passing under bridges, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example Difficulties</h4>
<p><strong>Routine:</strong> Diving up to 1'/skill rank into water. Every 180&deg; rotation per 10' fallen adds one complexity. For example, a 10' dive with one somersault (360&deg;) and a half turn (180&deg;) would add 3 difficulty levels.</p><p><strong>Easy:</strong> Diving up to 5'/skill rank into water. Diving off a bridge (or out a window, off a building, etc.) onto a static target. Hopefully, there is a waiting hay bale or dumpster. I f the maneuver is successful, the character may halve the distance of the fall when determining damage. <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> and/or <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Tumbling">Tumbling</a> may reduce this even further.</p><p><strong>Light:</strong> Diving up to 10'/skill rank into water.</p>
<p><strong>Medium:</strong> Diving up to 20'/skill rank into water. Diving off of a bridge onto a slow moving vehicle (e.g., a cart).</p><p><strong>Hard:</strong> Diving to a specific location from a great height (e.g., while skydiving) to a static location. For every 20' fallen, the diver can alter his horizontal distance by 1'/difficulty level above medium. For example, while falling 1,000', a character needs to maneuver 150' along the ground. This maneuver will be Extremely Hard. A diving maneuver cannot alter a fall by more than 5' per 20' fallen (an Absurd maneuver).</p><p><strong>Very Hard:</strong> Diving off a bridge onto a moving vehicle (e.g., a truck or horse).</p><p><strong>Sheer Folly:</strong> Diving off a bridge onto a fast vehicle (e.g., a train or Dragon).</p>

<p>Drafting has two main applications: generating a detailed and accurate representation of an actual object and generating a blueprint from which an object can be designed. Difficulties arise when the object is highly irregular or complex.<br>When Drafting is used to generate a blueprint for the creation of some object, the Drafting skill is only useful in generating the blueprint.

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>As in Riding, skill ranks in Driving must be developed separately for different types of vehicles. Vehicles are defined as animals pulling such objects as wagons, carts, sleighs, etc. One skill rank allows basic understanding of the controls; subsequent ranks reflect increased ability and some quickness in maneuvers.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>Animal powered vehicles are, in general, not particularly maneuverable. It is not possible to make right angle turns with such a vehicle. When the horses turn, the rear of the cart continues moving straight ahead until it is pulled into the curve.<br>
The difficulty of a Driving maneuver is dependent on two factors: the speed of the vehicle and how sharp the maneuver is. Also, smaller vehicles (like chariots) are more maneuverable than larger -wagons. The size of the vehicle may modify the difficulty of the maneuver by one level. The following examples assume that the vehicle is moving at a walking pace. Faster paces result in correspondingly more difficult maneuvers.<br>Partial and Near Successes indicate that the vehicle either skids in the direction in which it was traveling or begins to fish-tail. A Failure indicates that no change in direction is made; the animal ignores you. Absolute and Spectacular Failures may indicate that the vehicle crashes or rolls (as appropriate).<br>Note that animal-powered vehicles cannot maneuver faster than a sprint. It takes one round to accelerate one pace category (e.g., from jog to run).</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus to lazing about, drifting in and out of sleep, and falling asleep in uncomfortable or socially inappropriate places.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>This skill is very useful for characters that need to remain awake for extended periods of time. In general, a character loses one exhaustion point every hour he is awake. Thus, an average human can remain awake for 40 hours before collapsing from exhaustion. The Drowsing skill allows characters to take cat-naps in order to extend this amount of time. (It also annoys teachers.) A character can normally not sleep while some other distracting activity is going on. The Drowsing skill makes this possible. For example, a group of soldiers is traveling 24 hours a day. They take turns napping while riding in order to remain more alert. It only takes one half hour of sleep to recover all of one's exhaustion points. However, after each insufficient rest period (usually 6-8 hours), the rate of exhaustion point loss is increased by a factor of one. (For example, after 3 cat-naps a characters loses 4 exhaustion points per hour until he catches up on sleep.) A Drowsing maneuver can be made to fall into a light sleep, from which one can wake up easily. A failed maneuver can be interpreted in two ways: the character has fallen into a natural sleep, or the character failed to fall asleep (GM choice).</p><h4>Specialties</h4>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for speaking quickly, convincingly, and confusingly in order to get a victim to do something they would not ordinarily do. This skill usually may be used on only one person at a time.</p>
<h5>Notes</h5>
<p>This skill is useful when attempting to convince another that some action is reasonable, when in fact it is not. The difficulty of a Duping maneuver is dependent on how outrageous the action is. This skill can also be used to distract someone by causing the target to focus on the duper, and not on some other person or activity.<br>This skill differs from Bribery in that Bribery does not attempt to disguise the nature of the action. When bribing, it is obvious to the target that he should not allow the activity, but he is overcome by greed. This skill is distinct from Seduction in that Duping appeals to rationality rather than emotionality.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for knowing major facts about engineering of the appropriate technical level known to the culture. Also provides a bonus for attempts to utilize that knowledge in new engineering projects. A GM may require different types of Engineering to be treated as separate skills.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>Engineering combines aspects of mathematics, physics and invention. It provides a theoretical knowledge of devices and processes. An engineer understands how and why things work (but not necessarily how to build them). Engineers also try to produce systems that are maximally efficient.<br>Knowledge of engineering allows characters to determine what a device does, design new devices or stream line systems.The difficulty of an Engineering maneuver is dependent on the complexity of the device and the obscurity of the theory behind an item.</p>

<p>The goal of a Flying/Gliding maneuver is the successful (safe) completion of an in-air maneuver. Unlike <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Acrobatics">Acrobatics</a>, Flying/Gliding allows a character to change direction while in the air.<br>The difficulty of a Flying/Gliding maneuver is determined by the amount of precision required in order to complete the maneuver. A gentle bank or shallow dive is much simpler (and safer) than a sharp turn.<br>Note that many methods of flying are unable to execute maneuvers that involve hovering or changing direction suddenly. In most cases, it is not possible to stop maneuvering while flying. A character that ceases to make forward progress begins plummeting towards the ground. Some creatures (like Air Elementals) are able to control their movement completely and are therefore not required to make a maneuver roll.</p>
<h4>Specialties</h4>
<ul>
<li>Any specific method of flying.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example Difficulties</h4>
<p><strong>Routine:</strong> Flying. A maneuver roll is made to determine how far the character is able to fly this round. While flying a character cannot maneuver at a pace faster than a sprint. Accelerating one pace category (e.g., from a walk to a jog).</p><p><strong>Easy:</strong> Climbing. While climbing a character can not maneuver at a pace faster than a jog. Decelerating one pace category (e.g., from a jog to a walk). Accelerating two pace categories (e.g., from a jog to a sprint). Greater acceleration requires a dive.</p><p><strong>Light:</strong> Diving. Only while diving or swooping can a character attain a pace of fast sprint or dash. While diving, a character can accelerate as much as is desired without making an additional maneuver roll. (If the dive is successful, the acceleration is successful). Once the dive is completed, the character will automatically slow down one pace category per round until maneuvering at a sprint.</p><p><strong>Medium:</strong> Turning up to 90&deg;. Decelerating two pace categories (e.g., from a sprint to a jog). Landing as a 20% maneuver. (Landing is normally an automatic full action that occurs the round a character decelerates from a walk to stopped.)</p><p><strong>Hard:</strong> Swooping close enough to the ground to make an attack at the bottom of the dive. The character is allowed to make an attack using his entire OB; he cannot parry, but retains his natural DB. If this maneuver fails, the character crashes. Turning up to 120&deg;.</p>
<p><strong>Very Hard:</strong> Turning up to 150&deg;. Decelerating three pace categories (e.g., from a sprint to a walk). Pulling in one's wings in order to swoop through a tunnel, window, etc. The character automatically decelerates one pace category per turn.</p><p><strong>Extremely Hard:</strong> Turning up to 180&deg;. Executing spins or rolls. This is flashy, dangerous, and of little practical value.</p><p><strong>Sheer Folly:</strong> Turning up to 270&deg;. Decelerating four pace categories (e.g., from a dash to a jog).</p><p><strong>Absurd:</strong> Turning up to 360&deg;. Hovering.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for finding any local source of potable water or edible plants and animals. Includes basic food acquisition such as gathering or fishing.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>This skill is crucial to wilderness survival. Combined with the Survival skill, a character can survive indefinitely in the wilderness. This skill provides a character with a supply of water and vegetables (plants). Fishing and clamming are also covered by this skill. <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Set_Traps">Set Traps</a> and <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Hunting">Hunting</a> are more useful for obtaining meat.<br>The difficulty of this maneuver depends on the amount of food and water that is readily available. The maneuver is also modified by the number of people that need to be fed. These examples assume that only one person is being fed (and that one strategic turn, 4 hours is spent gathering). Each additional person increases the difficulty by one.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus to attempt to go into a state of single-minded, unpredictable rage which results in an additional +30 to melee OB, the ability to take twice normal concussion damage and the ability to deliver double melee concussion hit damage. While in frenzy, a characters has no DB other than the armor bonus, get no shield bonus, and cannot parry. The static maneuver (i.e., preparation) for frenzy takes one round. Once in a frenzied state, the berserker may make a static maneuver each round in order to resume his normal state. Once frenzied, the berserker will continue to fight until there is no one left standing except himself, at which time he receives a +30 modification to static maneuvers to end the frenzy. While frenzied, the berserker may attempt (with an Awareness roll at a -30 modification) to distinguish friend from foe.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for making plans for an uncommon or not yet invented item. The character does not receive materials or other essentials for the production of item (such as mathematics, laen, wood carving, etc.). The GM must approve the creation of any such item.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>Gimmickry is a skill that provides a character with a great deal of flexibility. Only the player's imagination (and his character's skill) limits the possible results of a gimmickry maneuver. The GM must carefully analyze any proposal. The use of Gimmickry is always tied to some other skill (like <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Engineering">Engineering</a> or <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Mechanition">Mechanition</a>). If the character has an insufficient understanding of any pre-requisite skills, no Gimmickry maneuver can be made. The difficulty of the maneuver depends on the character's other skills, the culture and technology, and how disruptive the invention would be to the game (e.g., inventing a portable explosive might make physical barriers irrelevant). Note that prototypes inevitably have many minor flaws.<br>This skill can also be used to provide temporary repairs or alterations to an object (jury-rigging). If the GM allows this, the Gimmickry maneuver does not have any pre-requisites. The character can simply attempt to make the repairs/modifications by making a maneuver roll. Whatever the result, jury-rigging is a temporary solution.</p>
<h4>Specialties</h4>
<ul>
<li>Any specific invention.</li>
<li>Making repairs to any specific object (e.g., catapults, car engines, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example Difficulties</h4>
<p><strong>Routine:</strong> Making trivial repairs.</p><p><strong>Easy:</strong> Temporarily tweaking an object in order to improve some aspect (e.g., allowing a crossbow to shoot 10% further).

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for designing or recognizing the particular heraldic crests (coats-of-arms) specific to a given culture. Separate cultures must be developed separately.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>This skill allows a character to gain knowledge aboutthe heraldic crests of a specific region/culture. The GM may want to provide the player with specific information before play begins. Knowledge of heraldry also implies a general understanding of politics. Crests are used to identify friend from foe. Thus, a herald can identify his enemies and allies if they are displaying a banner. In addition, coats-of-arms are used to trace lineage. As families branch and merge, their symbols also evolve. A herald is familiar with the genealogy of an area.<br>
Common crests are those displayed by lords and rulers. Uncommon crests are worn by organizations and merchant families. Personal crests are unique to a family name, but families that are closely connected will have similar crests.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Hiding is the ability to conceal one's presence by remaining still within a place of concealment, using silence, shadow and camouflage; Stalking is the same ability used when moving.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>The difficulty of a Hiding maneuver depends on the quality of the hiding place. The cover being used by the skulk may be solid or translucent; it is easier to hide behind a rock than in a shadow. This skill includes choosing a hiding place that is not obvious (e.g., behind a potted plant).<br>A Hiding maneuver is modified by the <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Alertness">Alertness</a> bonuses of all potential observers. I f the maneuver is successful, no <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Alertness">Alertness</a> maneuver should be made unless someone moves very near to the hidden character.

<h4>Specialties</h4>
<ul>
<li>Any specific environment (e.g., castles, forest, etc.).</li>
</ul><h4>Example Difficulties</h4>
<p><strong>Routine:</strong> There are ample places to hide that provide complete concealment. A warehouse of empty crates and a cluttered attic are two examples.</p><p><strong>Easy:</strong> There are many locations that provide at least 75% cover. For example, behind a curtain; in a large basket, or under a bed, or in a natural cavern.</p><p><strong>Light:</strong> There are many locations that provide 50% cover and ample deep shadows or other dark cover. A dense forest or jungle, or a garbage-filled alley are two examples.</p><p><strong>Medium:</strong> There are some physical obstructions (e.g., pillars, curtains, etc.) as well as ample dark corners/ cubbyholes.</p><p><strong>Hard:</strong> There are a many locations that provide 25% cover and many locations with partial cover (like bushes or smoke).

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides knowledge about the past. Onemay develop this skill in general World History (subject to the available learning materials &mdash; i.e., if knowledge about the other side of the world is not available it may not be learned) although the information will be far less specific, focusing instead on the broad strokes of history. If this skill is developed in the history of a particular region or subject, the information will be far more specific. In essence, the smaller the focus of the skill, the greater the level of detail and accuracy. Developing skill in the history of the Kingdom of Harran, for instance, might provide information about the rulers and the great events in the kingdom's past; skill in the history of the Guild of Architects in the city of Jeppod would likely include all of the names of the guild's officers, the bylaws memorized by heart, etc. This skill encompasses military history as well.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>This skill provides characters with historical information. The GM may want to provide some information prior to play. This information is useful in understanding current affairs, identifying historical landmarks and points of interest, and successful time travel.<br>In order to determine the difficulty of a History maneuver, the significance of the event in question must first be determined. A character with an equivalent knowledge level is familiar with the event. The amount of additional information the character is aware of depends on the maneuver attempted. For example, a character with knowledge level 4 is able to attempt a Medium maneuver about an event with significance 5 (e.g., a minor war), and can attempt a Light maneuver (difficulty 3) in order to determine the cause of the conflict.</p>

<h4>Specialties</h4>
<ul>
<li>Any specific type of plant (e.g., corn, oak trees, bonsai, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example Difficulties</h4>
<p><strong>Routine:</strong> Growing plants that are native to the area and require no special attention (e.g., grass).</p><p><strong>Easy:</strong> Growing wild-flowers or fruit in a controlled manner. Such plants tend to overpower their competitors for nutrients and water (e.g., raspberries).</p>
<p><strong>Light:</strong> Growing flowers that are native to the area that require some special attention (e.g., regular watering, fertilizing, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Medium:</strong> Growing a cash crop under normal conditions. This includes watering, fertilizing, weeding, and harvesting the crop.</p><p><strong>Hard:</strong> Growing a magical herb in natural conditions. The herb must be native to the area. The yield of salable product is generally quite low.</p><p><strong>Very Hard:</strong> Growing a plant from a different climate/region in a controlled environment (e.g., a greenhouse).</p><p><strong>Extremely Hard:</strong> Maintaining a garden that is always in bloom (by mixing plants of different types whose reproductive cycles differ). Kings pay handsomely for such gardens.</p><p><strong>Sheer Folly:</strong> Growing a magical herb under unnatural condition (e.g., indoors).</p><p><strong>Absurd:</strong> Growing a plant that requires bizarre conditions.

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus to Hunting maneuvers. Note that tracking and recognizing game is covered by other skills; this skill gives bonuses to the actual hunt, including setting up blind runs, leading and driving game, etc.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>This skill is used to find game and maneuver it into a position where it is within range of the hunter. This skill does not include bringing down the game, or trapping the game, merely identifying good hunting locations. If the maneuver roll is successful, the hunter has found game at long range (roughly 200'-300'). Every 50' difference modifies the maneuver by one difficulty level (to a maximum of 2). The hunter can try once every strategic turn (4 hours). A successful maneuver indicates that the hunter has found enough game to  feed 4 people (if he can kill it). Results above or below Success indicate more plentiful/larger or less plentiful/smaller game.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for placing a willing individual into a trance where they are responsive to suggestions. An unwilling individual receives a +50 RR bonus. Such an individual can be told to forget that they have been placed under hypnosis. He can be primed to perform some type of task which is triggered by a word. a gesture. a person. etc.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>This skill is most useful on persons willing or desiring to enter a hypnotic state. The hypnotist must first induce a hypnotic state in the target. At this point the hypnotist is able to cause the individual to perform various actions or access unconscious memories. Post-hypnotic suggestions are the most difficult maneuvers.</p>
<h4>Specialties</h4>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>The difficulty of an interrogation is dependent on the subject being interrogated. The interrogator will generally ask a series of questions, hoping to catch inconsistencies and implied information. This is useful for criminal investigations as well as more general information gathering. The interrogator must often extract the truth from an abundance of lies.<br>It is not necessarily easy to get information from co-operative subjects. The subject may not be good at expressing himself; it is the interrogator's job to ask the proper questions. It is even more difficult to interrogate a subject who is attempting to cover up or who does not want the interrogator to learn the information.</p>
<h4>Specialties</h4>
<ul>
<li>Torture, investigative reporting, witness interrogation, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example Difficulties</h4>
<p><strong>Routine:</strong> Gleaning relevant information from an articulate and cooperative subject.</p><p><strong>Easy:</strong> Determining if the subject is deliberately withholding information. (This does not imply guilt, however.)</p><p><strong>Light:</strong> Extracting useful information from an incoherent, but cooperative, subject.</p><p><strong>Medium:</strong> Obtaining clues from an uncooperative subject. Such clues generally provide non-information (e.g., the murder weapon is not in the fireplace).</p><p><strong>Hard:</strong> Piecing together information from a number of sources, none of whom are particularly observant. Most witnesses at a crime scene seem to fall into this category.

<h4>Description</h4>
<p><strong><em>Rolemaster</em></strong> is created for a world with a variety of cultures and languages. There is no such thing as a common tongue or an alignment tongue (though a GM can add them for his world system), although certain professions have developed their own languages for use in research. Each language must be developed individually, with the written and spoken versions of a language each counting separately. Skills in one language normally have little effect on others; however, "brother languages," those deriving from an immediate common ancestor, may be an exception.<br>
One's skill rank indicates the level of comprehension of a spoken or written language.<br>
One's skill bonus with a written form of language serves as a skill bonus to writing attempts using that language. The spoken skill bonus for a language is used to improve communication with someone. A successful static maneuver means that the spoken language rank of the person with whom you are communicating is temporarily increased for the purposes of this conversation, to a maximum of the rank developed by the individual performing the static maneuver. See the <em>Mentalism Companion</em>.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>Leadership is primarily used in two situations. A leader can attempt to recruit/attract an army. In this case, the leader must first raise a small army (Routine maneuver), and build from there. He can continue making Leadership maneuvers to grow his army until he fails a maneuver roll, or until there are no more available recruits in the area. (Roughly 1% of a population can be recruited unless the leader is also a ruler. Rulers can recruit up to 10% of the population unless the safety of the nation is at stake.) Leadership is also used to maintain morale. The difficulty of the maneuver depends on the gravity of the situation.

<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>Magical languages enable spell users to enhance theeffects of their spells. The difficulty of such a maneuver depends on how powerful an effect the spell user desires to attain. Each magical language can affect a specific category of spell lists whose effects are similar (e.g., detection spells, scrying spells, movement spells, etc.). In addition to the suggestions below, there are two standard uses of magical languages that a GM can utilize:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Before making a spell casting static maneuver roll, the caster can make an appropriate Magical Languages maneuver. Any resulting subsequent maneuver modifier is applied to the following spell casting static maneuver (i.e., +10 for Near Success, +20 for Success, +30 for Absolute Success).</p></li>
<li><p>Modify a <a href="../en,lproj/skills.html#Spell_Mastery">Spell Mastery</a> maneuver by +1 for each appropriate Magical Languages skill rank.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4>Specialties</h4>
<ul>
<li>Any specific spell list.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example Difficulties</h4>
<p><strong>Routine:</strong> +1 to a BAR or +5 to an EAR.</p><p><strong>Easy:</strong> Increasing a spell's effective level by 1 (for RRs, durations, etc.).</p><p><strong>Light:</strong> +2 to a BAR or +10 to an EAR.</p><p><strong>Medium:</strong> Increasing a spell's effective level by 2.</p><p><strong>Hard:</strong> Modifying the target's RR by -10.</p><p><strong>Very Hard:</strong> Increasing a spell's effective level by 3. +3 to a BAR or +15 to an EAR.</p><p><strong>Extremely Hard:</strong> Modifying the target's RR by -20.</p>
<p><strong>Sheer Folly:</strong> Increasing a spell's effective level by 5.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for enhancing a spell ef-fect or duplicating a spell effect outside of normal spell resolution parameters (e.g., no power point expenditure). GM's are warned that this skill can be easily abused. GM's should understand how magic works in their world before implementing this skill. Magic rituals are not for hack-and-slash campaigns. Think of Celtic witches' incantations or Shamanistic dances and you have a good idea how this skill should work. (Other skills can complement this skill such as <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Herb_Lore">Herb Lore</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Dancing">Dancing</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Demon/Devil_Lore">Demon/Devil Lore</a>, <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Poetry">Poetry</a> and <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Singing">Singing</a> to make chants, etc.). Be imaginative. Be careful.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>See the <em>Essence Companion</em>, <em>Channeling Companion</em>, <em>Mentalism Companion</em>, and <em>Arcane Companion</em> for more information on magic rituals. This skill can be used to cast ritual spells that do not require Power Points. Subtract the combined levels of the casters from the following sum:</p>
<code>
Level of the first spell +2 x Level of the second spell + 
3 x Level of the third spell, etc.
</code>
<p>Reference the result below. The time needed to cast the spell is also indicated.<br>For example, 3 spell casters (all level 10) are attempting to cast a 5th, 10th and 25th level spell. The differenceis (25 + 10 x 2 + 5 x 3 - 10 x 3) = 30. This ritual would be a Sheer Folly maneuver and require 30 minutes to complete.</p>

<p>This skill provides a bonus to making, recognizing and using simple maps. This skill is not capable of producing fully detailed maps like those of a cartographer, but it is sufficient to the task of marking out one's journey well enough to find one's way home.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>Mapping allows a character to maintain a crude map. The difficulty of this maneuver is dependent on the amount of detail the player wants the GM to provide. More accurate maps require the <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Cartography">Cartography</a> skill.</p>

<p>This skill provides a bonus for building and using a machine that already exists. It will be necessary to have the appropriate skills to build the machine. Each type of machine must be learned as a separate skill.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>A successful Mechanition maneuver indicates that the character has built an effective machine. Partial Success indicate that the machine has various flaws or quirks. A  vehicle might pull in a specific direction; the roof of a covered battering ram might leak; etc.<br>
The difficulty of the maneuver depends on the complexity of the machine being created.

Skill must be developed separately for each culture or region as applicable to the GM's world scheme.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>The skill provides the character and player with knowledge about the metals found in a specific region. Unlike many Lore skills, the GM will probably not be able to provide the player with information prior to play.<br>The rarity of a given metal must first be determined. Common metals (like iron) probably have a rarity of 1. Precious metals and alloys have a higher rarity rating, and magical and enchanted metals, the highest rarity rating.

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for working with normal metals to create or repair desired objects (e.g., horse shoes, metal ornaments). Bonus for oven or kiln building, and doubling effects of fires.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>The difficulty of metal-working depends on the intricacy of the final product. Even a large, bulky product might require very detailed workmanship in order to function properly (e.g., a clock). Like many crafts skills, this skill assumes that the craftsman has an adequate supply of tools. Without the necessary implements, there is little a craftsman can do.

<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>Military Organization is used in the day-to-day maintenance of a military force. Without sufficient military organization, a unit slowly degrades into chaos. A successful maneuver is required each month in order to maintain a unit. If the maneuver fails, the unit's morale and offensive bonus will begin to deteriorate. The difficulty of maintaining a force depends on the size of the unit. It is common practice to generate multiple command layers such that each leader is responsible for a smaller number of units.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for determining proper directions and distances when using a map in conjunction with various directional aids, such as a compass, sextant, clock, etc. This includes a concept of orienting, and is applicable on land, water or the stars. Note that this skill is far more precise and complex than <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Orienteering">Orienteering</a>.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>This skill is used to prevent a character from getting lost while traveling. Use of this skill allows a character to travel from point A to point B without getting lost. The character must have the necessary equipment and maps (including at least a compass). As long as this skill is successful, a character will not get lost. (A maneuver should be made each day of travel.)</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for noticing details about the environment for assimilation and analysis. This is normally only usable in an active fashion, and requires concentration. Note that this skill is different from <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Alertness">Alertness</a>, which represents a general and unconscious level of receptivity and awareness of events and details within one's immediate environment. This skill reflects the active observation, noting and appraisal of such details. For example, if a character were about to make camp in an unsafe location, the GM might make an <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Alertness">Alertness</a> maneuver for that character to determine whether or not he notices the danger. If the character indicated that he wished to examine the location for suitability, the character would instead make an Observation maneuver.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>This skill has numerous applications. It is used to find people hiding in the brush. It is used to examine an object closely, looking for any anomalies. It is used to determine the number of enemies in the opposing army.<br>As a result, it is not possible to describe even a fraction of the situations in which Observation could be used. Instead, broad general guidelines are provided.<br>
 The level of difficulty should be based on the amount of information the character is seeking. The obviousness of the information can modify this difficulty by up to two levels. For example, determining the safety of the aforementioned campsite might be a Medium maneuver. However, the presence of a Troll's burrow nearby might be a subtle clue to look elsewhere for a campsite.<br>This skill can be used to discover persons who are <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Stalking">Stalking</a> or <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Hiding">Hiding</a>. It can also be used to see through a disguise, notice a camouflaged object or realize that a voice is being mimicked. It cannot be used to find hidden objects, which requires the skill <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Locate_Hidden">Locate Hidden</a>.</p>
<h4>Specialties</h4>
<ul>
<li>Any specific topic of inquiry.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example Difficulties</h4>
<p><strong>Routine:</strong> The character knows exactly what he is looking for and is merely trying to verify some detail. For example, T'mar knows that the king has a mole on his right hand. While shaking the king's hand, he checks to make sure that this really is the king.</p><p><strong>Easy:</strong> The information being sought is obvious provided any time is spent looking (e.g., noticing an object that has been hastily camouflaged).</p><p><strong>Light:</strong> The character has excellent knowledge about some object (person, creature, etc.) and is looking for details in order to distinguish between two similar objects.</p><p><strong>Medium:</strong> The information being sought by the character is general in nature (e.g., "Are there any signs of recent habitation in the cottage?").</p><p><strong>Hard:</strong> The character's knowledge of the subject is fair and he has some idea of what he is looking for. For example, a weapons master is attempting to assess his opponent's skill by watching him practice.</p><p><strong>Very Hard:</strong> The information being sought is specific in nature. For example, there is debris everywhere, and a character is interested in determining if the door was ripped off its hinges or battered down.</p><p><strong>Extremely Hard:</strong> The character's knowledge of the object is poor, and the character is not certain what he is looking for. (But he'll recognize it when he sees it!)</p><p><strong>Sheer Folly:</strong> The information is trivial in nature, and not at all obvious. For example, determining if a vial ever held olive oil.</p><p><strong>Absurd:</strong> The character has no knowledge about the subject of inquiry. The player is merely hoping to roll well enough to get some insight from the GM.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>Without this skill, a character is guaranteed to get lost if not following a road or river. Additional ranks will help a character avoid getting lost in heavy terrain or cloudy weather. A maneuver roll should be made every strategic turn (4 hours). Failure generally indicates that the character heads in a direction up to 60&deg; degrees from the direction intended.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for recognizing and identifying major aspects of philosophic doctrines. Each philosophy doctrine may be concentrated in and learned separately for in-depth knowledge and understanding.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>Philosophy is the study of thought. There are many branches of philosophy. all of which strive for enlightenment and truth through the application of logic. (Even though logic itself is a philosophical field.) At the core of most doctrines is the search for morality. that which should be done for its own sake.<br>The difficulty of a Philosophy maneuver depends on the amount of logic and faith to be applied to a given situation. Memorizing the tenets of a philosophy is much easier than applying those maxims accurately. Note that different philosophies will find different situations difficult.<br>Most schools of philosophy fall into three major categories:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Rule-based</em>. Philosophy is the application of universal rules (or imperatives) to all situations.</li>
<li><em>Situational</em>. The proper course of action depends on the actual circumstances and the persons involved.</li>
<li><em>Existential</em>. Each person defines his own reality. Truth can only be perceived. and only applies to the person perceiving.</li>

For example, demonstrating that it is wrong to cheat on a test.</p>
<p><strong>Medium:</strong> Knowledge of more subtle facets of a philosophy. This includes a critical analysis of its weaknesses.</p>
<p><strong>Hard:</strong> Applying a philosophical belief to a complex situation (i.e., one in which multiple parties have valid cases).</p><p><strong>Very Hard:</strong> Familiarity with classic examples of conundrums that have been solved. (Is it wrong to tell a murderer that the person he is hunting is not in your house to protect the potential victim. even though you are lying?)</p><p><strong>Extremely Hard:</strong> Resolving an untenable position.

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for perceiving the presence of poison in or on an item or object. Note that some poisons will simply be undetectable (e.g., a colorless, tasteless, odorless powder that dissolves completely in water, will be very difficult if not impossible to detect).</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>The difficulty of detecting a poison depends on the method of application (pastes are usually obvious) and the number of senses that can detect the poison. For example, cyanide has a distinctive odor, although if mixed with some food that masks the poison, it is more difficult to detect.<br>The base difficulties assume that the poison can be seen, smelled and tasted. For each sense removed, add one to the difficulty. For example, iocaine is a powder that is colorless, odorless and tasteless. It is an Absurd maneuver to detect this poison. Sharkasar is a paste that has an odor and is dark brown. Since it has no taste, it is a Light maneuver to detect this poison.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for influencing others through indirect means, rather than direct speech. Includes such ideas as starting rumors, as well as designing large advertising campaigns.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>Propaganda is used to influence public opinion. It can be used to lower the public's opinion of their leader, justify a war, or anything a clever manipulator can dream of. Unlike advertising, this skill is not trying to sell a product. The effects of propaganda are more ethereal than profit (although the two are certainly related).<br>The difficulty of the attempt depends on how much of a change is being attempted. This assumes, naturally, that the allegation, claim, or assertion is plausible. The more outrageous the statement, the more difficult it's going to be to sell it to the public.<br>In general, successful use of this skill will modify public opinion by up to 5%.<br>The following examples assume that a small number of people are being influenced, fewer than 100. For each factor of 100, the difficulty should be increased by one. Hence, a Propaganda maneuver intended to affect a country of 1,000,000 inhabitants would be increased by two levels of difficulty.</p>
<h4>Specialties</h4>
<ul>
<li>Any specific culture.</li>
<li>Any type of claim (political, religious, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example Difficulties</h4>
<p><strong>Routine:</strong> A claim that is very reasonable. For example, Aeron is known for his sexual exploits. It is not difficult to convince the public that he is having an affair.</p><p><strong>Easy:</strong> A claim that is truthful, but sounds implausible. Continuing the above example, it would be an Easy maneuver to convince the public that the allegations of impropriety are wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Light:</strong> A claim that reinterprets the truth. Spin doctors attempt such maneuvers to re-direct public attention to a different aspect of a situation.</p><p><strong>Medium:</strong> A claim whose assertions cannot be verified. For example, there is a vast government conspiracy that includes the disappearance of its citizens. The very nature of the claim prohibits verification.</p><p><strong>Hard:</strong> A claim that is contrary to the public's morals or beliefs. Convincing a tolerant public that Orcs are pondscum would be a Hard maneuver.</p><p><strong>Very Hard:</strong> A claim that requires the public to re-examine some core religious or cultural belief. The Protestant Reformation would be one example.</p><p><strong>Extremely Hard:</strong> Inspiring the public to take action about some concern that is relevant to them and not contrary to their beliefs. For example, a campaign to convince more people to bathe regularly.</p><p><strong>Sheer Folly:</strong> Convincing the public to stop performing some mundane activity, including a successful product ban.</p><p><strong>Absurd:</strong> Inspiring the public to take some action that goes against their core beliefs. Inciting a rebellion through propaganda alone, for example. (This would be much easier if a strong leader were to emerge.)</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>This skill is used to directly influence an audience (unlike <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Propaganda">Propaganda</a>, which is used to indirectly influence the public). The difficulty of the attempt depends on how much attention the audience is paying, and how radical the recommendations of the speaker.

They will probably agree based solely off of their impression of the speaker (e.g., a hero returning to his homeland).</p><p><strong>Hard:</strong> The message modifies a common belief, but does not directly contradict it. For example, reminding people that a free and just society can harshly punish those who threaten freedom and justice.</p><p><strong>Very Hard:</strong> The audience is bored or disinterested.</p>
<p><strong>Extremely Hard:</strong> The message is contrary to the audience's beliefs. Convincing the audience that a criminal should   be released, or that they should voluntarily pay taxes.</p><p><strong>Sheer Folly:</strong> The audience is trying to ignore the speaker.

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for recognizing and identifying major aspects of religious doctrines. Each religion may be concentrated in and learned separately for in-depth knowledge and understanding.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>This skill provides characters with knowledge of one or more religions. The GM may want to provide the player with some information prior to play. Knowledge of religion is useful in understanding motivations and beliefs, which can be heavily influenced by religion. A successful Religion maneuver might provide a character with insight into a religious leader's reaction to an event, or how to motivate a congregation into action. This skill can also be used to defend the tenets of a faith within a certain context. (If God is good, why is there evil in the world?)

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for the propulsion of watercraft through the use of paddles, oars, or poles. It combines the skills required to control and guide the craft with the coordination to work with others in rhythm (when necessary), in addition to the marshaling and pacing of internal resources to last throughout the journey.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>Rowed vehicles are, in general, not particularly maneuverable, but they are more maneuverable than a sailing vehicle. It is possible to make relatively tight turns since each side of the vehicle can act of the other. Attaining speed in a rowed vehicle is more difficult than with a sailing vehicle, however.<br>The difficulty of a rowing maneuver is dependent on two factors: the speed of the vehicle and how sharp the maneuver is. Also, smaller vehicles (like rowboats) are more maneuverable than longships. The size of the vehicle may modify the difficulty of the maneuver by one level. The following examples assume that the vehicle is moving at a walking pace. Faster paces result in correspondingly more difficult maneuvers.<br>Partial and Near Successes indicate that the vehicle begins to rock and might take on water. Failure indicates that the vehicle performs no maneuver and slows by one pace category. Absolute and Spectacular Failures may indicate that the vehicle tips. It takes one round to accelerate one pace category (e.g., from jog to run).<br>These examples also assume a complete crew. Fewer rowers than normal will reduce the base speed by a similar amount. For example, a longship that requires 30 rowers has only 15. It moves at half speed. If there are fewer than one fourth of the necessary crew, the ship cannot move.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for maneuvering a watercraft with one or more sails. It includes the skills required to control and guide such a craft as well as perform routine maintenance.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>Sailing vessels are, in general, not maneuverable, but they are much faster than rowed vessels. Even when sailing into the wind, many sailing vessels can move quite rapidly.<br>The difficulty of a Sailing maneuver is dependent on two factors: the speed of the vessel and how sharp the maneuver is. Also, smaller vessels (like river boats) are more maneuverable than galleys or long-ships. The size of the vessel may modify the difficulty of the maneuver by one level. The following examples assume that the vessel is moving at a walking pace. Faster paces result in correspondingly more difficult maneuvers.<br>If a Sailing maneuver fails, the boat fails to maneuver; it continues in the direction it was heading the previous round, decelerating one pace category, to a minimum of a walk. Absolute and Spectacular Failures might cause the ship to be damaged or capsized. Partial and Near Successes probably indicate that the boat takes on water.<br>The maximum attainable pace depends on whether or not the vessel is moving with the wind (dash), against the wind Gog), or perpendicular to the wind (sprint).</p>

<p>The sculptor's goal is the representation of a real object, scene or person. This representation is usually realistic, but may be symbolic or emotive. The difficulty of the maneuver depends on the beauty and depth of expression of the piece of art to be produced. As a sculptor gains skill, he is able to incorporate greater detail.

The existence of this as an acquirable skill indicates one's ability to train one's level of sensitivity to such things, but more active observation should be handled by the skills of <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Observation">Observation</a> and/or <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Situational_Awareness">Situational Awareness</a>.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>This skill provides a penalty to <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Ambush">Ambush</a> maneuvers. This skill can also be used to detect traps as they are being triggered. If the result of the maneuver is some level of success, the character may be able to react before it's too late.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus to the individual's ability to discern detail and information through the use of a particular sense (i.e., sight, touch, etc.). Note that skill for each sense must be developed separately.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>Sense Awareness is used automatically to detect features of the environment. The difficulty of this maneuver depends on the size or strength of the stimulus in relation to background stimuli. A Dragon on the horizon is more noticeable than a pickpocket in a crowd. Even a Dragon cannot be seen, however, if it is far enough away.<br>
Guidelines are provided for sight and sound. Other senses can be extrapolated from the examples given.</p>
<p><strong>Sight:</strong> An average human can spot a single man-sized figure at a distance of 500 yards. Below are the average distances at which various objects can be discerned. Details cannot be discerned until the object is one category closer. ver by ±10:</p>
<table summary="" >
<tr><th>Object Size</th><th align="right">Average Distance to Discern</th></tr>
<tr><td>Minute</td><td align="right">10 feet</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tiny</td><td align="right">100 feet</td></tr>

</table>
<p>For example, spotting a Dragon at a range of one half mile gets a bonus of +10. Noticing a minute detail at 30' gets a penalty of -20. If the object is moving, there is an additional bonus of +10.</p>
<p><strong>Sound:</strong> An average human can discern a normal conversation from 50 feet away. Below are the average distances at which various volumes can be discerned. Details cannot be discerned until the object is one category closer. Each factor modifies the maneuver by ±10:</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>This skill is used primarily for orientation rolls and to avoid surprise. When in a potential surprise situation, each character should make a Situational Awareness maneuver. The total of the maneuver roll indicates the amount of activity that character has to use during the round of surprise. The difficulty is generally Medium.<br>An orientation roll is required whenever a situation changes dramatically (e.g., following a teleport, the arrival of a new combatant, etc.). The total of the maneuver roll indicates what percentage of activity the character can devote to a reaction. His remaining activity must assume that no change has occurred. The difficulty depends on how dramatic the change was.<br>Note that it is reasonable for both sides of an encounter to be surprised by the other.<br>Note also that a character who fails this maneuver can only act during the deliberate phase. Near and Partial Success indicates that the character can act during the normal phase. A complete Success allows the character to act during any phase.</p>

If more or less time is spent preparing the spell, the difficulty of the maneuver is modified by one difficulty level for every round of difference. Instantaneous spells have a straight -30 mod.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill allows the user to modify spells within or beyond basic parameters. Each individual spell list requires separate skill development (as with <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Riding">Riding</a> or Weapon skills). This skill might be used to change the orientation upon arrival of the target of a Teleport spell, or it might be used to allow a spell user to attempt to alter a bolt spell into a ball spell. The character should use the <a href="../en.lproj/tables.html#RMFRP_SM-7.17">Power Manipulation Static Maneuver Table SM-7.17</a> (p. 141) to resolve Spell Mastery maneuvers. The result may indicate success or failure, as well as provide a modifier to any related Spell Casting static maneuvers.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>This skill is often used to increase the range, duration or area of effect of a spell, although there are a number of different uses. This skill can be used to incorporate a visual illusion into the spell. (For example, a Shock Bolt with the head of an eagle or Demon.) It can be used to tweak the effects of a spell. (For example, modifying a bolt so that it strikes the target directly, without arcing from the caster to the target.) This skill can also be used to add new parameters to a spell. (For example, a wall that can slowly advance.) Spell Mastery can be used to lessen the effects of a spell, or to improve the caster's control over the spell's force. The possibilities are limited only by the spell caster's imagination (and the GM).<br>The difficulty of the maneuver depends on how dramatic the change is. In addition, the following modifiers may also be applied:</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>sing this skill to maneuver on a flat, smooth surface (like a race-track) is detailed in <a href="../books/5800.html#RMFRP_16.0">Section 16.0</a> of <em>RMFRP</em> (p. 51). Unfortunately, characters rarely find themselves on ideal running surfaces. The following examples assume that a character is dashing with a weight penalty of -1 to -10 (normally a Medium maneuver).

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Stalking is the ability to move using silence, camouflage, and shadows to conceal your presence; <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Hiding">Hiding</a> is the same ability used when not moving.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>This skill involves moving from one location to another without being seen or heard. A character attempting to stalk should make two maneuver rolls, one for sound and one for sight. Should either fail, the thief has been spotted. In some situations, only one maneuver roll may be necessary (e.g., approaching a target from behind, silenced, while invisible, etc.).<br>The difficulty of remaining unseen should be referenced under Hiding. The difficulty of remaining silent depends on how armored the thief is, and how noisy the ground is. This maneuver roll should be modified by double the Missile Attack Penalty (<em>RMFRP</em>, p. 215) of the armor worn.</p>

<p>This skill is used to win the trust of a criminal or underworld society. It includes knowing the slang, who to hate and who to respect. A successful maneuver is required when a character interacts with a person who has legitimate reason to fear the law. If the maneuver is not successful, the criminal will not interact with the character for fear of discovery. Law enforcement officials need this skill to infiltrate criminal organizations.<br>Once a character is a member of a given organization, he need make a maneuver roll only when interacting with other organizations, or with the leaders of his own organization. The difficulty of the maneuver depends on how much the criminal has at stake. (The guildmaster of the assassin's guild probably doesn't trust anyone.) The GM may adjust the difficulty of the maneuver if the character has been particularly faithful to the organization or individual.</p><h4>Specialties</h4>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus to Surfing maneuvers. This includes body, board, and channel surfing.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>The goal of a surfer is the successful completion of a maneuver performed while suspended above the surface of the water. The surfer is largely at the whim of the waves, but he can change orientation within the waves. The difficulty of any maneuver depends on the height of the wave and the complexity of the maneuver performed inside the wave. Increase the difficulty of the maneuver by one for every 5 feet of waves.</p>
<h4>Specialties</h4>
<ul>
<li>Any specific coast.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example Difficulties</h4>
<p><strong>Routine:</strong> Body surfing a small wave.</p><p><strong>Easy:</strong> Maneuvering while lying on a surfboard.</p><p><strong>Light:</strong> Body surfing a large wave.</p><p><strong>Medium:</strong> Riding a wave while standing.</p><p><strong>Hard:</strong> Changing orientation while riding a wave.</p><p><strong>Very Hard:</strong> Riding beneath the crest of a wave.</p>
<p><strong>Extremely Hard:</strong> Completing a full rotation under a wave.</p>
<p><strong>Sheer Folly:</strong> Recovering after falling.</p><p><strong>Absurd:</strong> Jumping from wave to wave.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for keeping watch over a person, place or object. Also includes the ability to determine the best approach and technique in solving a crime.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>This skill is useful in a number of different contexts. It can be used by criminals or spies to case an establishment; the criminal is seeking information about the frequency and consistency of various activities. Conversely, guards use this skill to maintain an extended watch. As long as the guard is attentive, he can use his Surveillance skill to notice potential disturbances.<br>This skill is also used to tail another person. The pursuer maintains a safe distance in order not to be seen. A successful maneuver indicates that the target has not been lost, and has no (additional) reason to suspect anything. Failure indicates that the target has shaken his tail (the pursuer). Partial and Near Successes indicate that the pursuer has not lost the target, but the target may notice his tail.</p><h4>Specialties</h4>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for living in a specific dangerous or hostile environment. Note that this skill encompasses only those methods needed to stay alive against the actively dangerous elements of an environment (e.g., blistering heat, cold, pressure, unusual animals typical of the environment, etc.). It does not include gathering food, although it does include the knowledge necessary to find water. Skill must be developed in each type of environment (e.g., desert, jungle, arctic, water, etc.). The GM may rule that unusually hostile environments may also be covered by this skill (e.g., vacuum, underwater, elemental planes of fire, etc.).</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>The difficulty of a Survival maneuver depends on the harshness of the environment. The more dangerous the environment, the more frequently the character must make a maneuver to avoid taking damage. This maneuver should be made at least once a week, and no more frequently than once an hour.</p>
<h4>Specialties</h4>
<ul>
<li>Any specific region.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example Difficulties</h4>
<p><strong>Routine:</strong> The climate is uncomfortable, but not dangerous.</p><p><strong>Easy:</strong> The climate is only dangerous after extended exposure. This might include a warm or cool climate that has more extreme temperatures at noon or midnight. (A maneuver roll should be made once each week.)</p><p><strong>Light:</strong> The climate is warm or cool and wet or dry. The difficulties of such an environment include insects, exposure, etc. (A maneuver roll should be made once each week.)</p><p><strong>Medium:</strong> The climate is hot or cold, but there is an appropriate amount of water. Threats might include dangerous plants, exposure, etc. (A maneuver roll should be made once a day.)</p><p><strong>Hard:</strong> The climate is hot or cold and wet or dry (jungle, desert, tundra, etc.). Threats include any of the above, plus dangerous terrain (like sinkholes, quicksand, etc.). (A maneuver roll should be made once a day.)</p><p><strong>Very Hard:</strong> The climate is harsh. If the character does not have adequate shelter and clothing, death is certain. (A maneuver roll should be made once each strategic turn.)</p><p><strong>Extremely Hard:</strong> The climate is harsh and the terrain is dangerous. (A maneuver roll should be made once each strategic turn.)</p><p><strong>Sheer Folly:</strong> Survival is not normally possible. The climate of the polar regions or harshest deserts qualify. (A maneuver should be made once an hour.)</p><p><strong>Absurd:</strong> The climate/terrain exceeds human capabilities. Extreme circumstances must exist (e.g., an elemental plane, a vacuum, etc.). The character has only limited survival equipment. (A maneuver should be made once an hour.)</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill allows an individual to perform elaborate maneuvers with his weapon, including flourishes and feats of weapon control. This skill may, at the GM's discretion, be used to recover control of a fumbled weapon (only possible if a fumble result has indicated that the wielder has "lost control" of a weapon, not "dropped" it), and may be used to perform unusual maneuvers with one's weapon. Note that fumbles resulting from swashbuckling attempts may not be negated by further use of this skill.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>This skill can be used in a number of ways. The most obvious is the recovery of a fumbled weapon. This skill can also be used for fantastic weapon flourishes. This can be used to intimidate an opponent or impress them with your skill.</p>
<h4>Specialties</h4>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>Resolving a Tactical Games maneuver is different from resolving other maneuvers. It is not possible to perform a Tactical Games maneuver unless one has an opponent. Each player should secretly determine the difficulty of the maneuver they are attempting. Whichever player succeeds at the most difficult maneuver, wins a point. A Partial Success reduces the difficulty by two levels, a Near Success, by one. An Absolute Success increases the difficulty by one level, an unusual by two. A given game may require the accumulation of multiple points before a winner is determined.</p>
<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Laern and Taelen are playing Genesis (the game of Life). This game is played to three points. On the first round, both players attempt a Medium maneuver. Both succeed; neither gains a point. On the second round, both attempt a Hard maneuver. Laern succeeds; Taelen does not. Laern gets a point. The next round, Laern attempts a Light maneuver, and Taelen, a Hard maneuver. Laern gets an Absolute Success, increasing his maneuver to Medium. Taelen gets a Partial Success, reducing his maneuver to Light; Laern wins a second point. Finally, both attempt a Hard maneuver. Laern gets a Near Success and Taelen a Partial Success. Laern wins a third and final point.</blockquote>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>This skill is used to provide an army or group of combatants with a bonus to their OB. If the maneuver roll is successful, the combatants can receive the subsequent maneuver bonus as a bonus to their OB, provided they follow the tacticians' plans.

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill provides a bonus for determining the time of day or how much time has passed over a specific period. This is a combination of the ability to estimate internally the passage of time, as well as using external references such as the sun, stars, etc. When no external references are available (e.g., underground, in a jail cell, etc.), it is significantly more difficult to estimate the passage of time. Also, after sleep or unconsciousness one typically requires the use of external reference to "reset" one's internal clock; the lack of same will hinder the use of this skill.<br>This skill may be used to attempt to wake oneself from sleep at a predetermined time.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>A Time Sense maneuver has few difficulty modifiers. If the maneuver is successful, substract the amount of the maneuver roll over 100 from 100 (e.g., 125 results in 100-25 = 75). Treat results below 0 as O. The result is the accuracy of the information provided by the GM. (Continuing the above example, ±75%.) The GM should not provide a range, since that might offer more information than is appropriate.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This skill allows a combatant to fight with two weapons simultaneously. He is allowed to make two weapon attacks for each melee attack action, and may engage two opponents providing neither opponent is receiving any positional combat modifiers for their OB (e.g., If either opponent is receiving a +15 for flank attack or +20 for rear attack the individual cannot attack both opponents in the same round).<br>Two-weapon Combat skill must be developed for <strong>each</strong> individual two-weapon combination (e.g., short sword/ handaxe, rapier/dagger, etc.). A character's skill rank with a two-weapon combination may not exceed his skill rank of either of the individual weapons (e.g., if a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighter</a> has 5 skill ranks with a dagger and 9 skill ranks with a short sword, he may only have 5 skill ranks with his short sword/dagger two-weapon combination).

<p>In order to calculate the amount of weight a character can lift from the ground to above his head use the following formula (Treat non-postive St bonuses as one.):</p><pre>Max Lift = (body wt. &div; 2) +(temp Strength stat x Strength stat bonus) &div; 5</pre><p>Thus, an average human (with a strength of 50 who weighs 200 lbs.) can lift 110 lbs. An exceptional human (with a strength of 90) can lift 190 lbs. An incredible human (with a strength of 100) can lift 300 lbs. With a good Weight-lifting maneuver, that person would be an Olympic contender.<br>Combined with Power-throwing, this skill allows characters to use any large object as a weapon.</p>

<!-- AppleSegStart="Optional Magic Balance Rules" -->
<h1><a name="SoHK_10.0">10.0</a> Optional Magic Balance Rules</h1>
<p>Sometimes it seems like magic and spell users overrun a campaign. Who needs a Fighter when the Magician can de- stroy dozens of opponents with a single fireball? Why bother to pick the lock when a simple spell will open the door, disin- tegrate the wall or even teleport the party to the other side?<br>Many players and GMs do not like the feel of a game where magic dominates every aspect of life. Consider some of the classic fantasy sagas. The Lord of the Rings and Conan are both popular settings in which most of the characters are non spell users. Certainly magic exists, but a character does not have to use it to be a hero.<br>Some GMs and players feel that the Rolemaster system is weighted toward the spell user, especially at high levels. These optional rules attempt to address these concerns by giving the Gamemaster some ways to restore the balance of power among professions.</p>
<h4><a name="SoHK_10.0.0.1">10.0.0.1</a> DEALING WITH MAGIC</h4>
<p>How should a Gamemaster deal with limiting the use of magic? In this section we provide several optional rules that give mechanical ways for dealing with them. The various risk factor charts can make magic more dangerous, as can the rules for corruption (see <em>Character Law</em>, p.112). On the other hand, the rules for spell visibility and resistance skills can bring the non spell users up to the same power level as spell users. It is just a question of whether you want to weaken spell users, strengthen non spell users, or do a little of both.<br>Another possibility is to put a limit on the number of spell users in the group. The premise behind this is that magic is a rare ability, and there are only so many possible spell users in a given population. The population of active adventurers will typically have a higher proportion of magic than the general population, but it is still reasonable to set limits.<br>This allows the GM to set exactly the level of magic that he wants. The GM should pick a fraction of the group that he is willing to allow for spell users. If the GM picks 2/5, then two out of every five characters could be a pure spell user. Semi spell users should count as half a pure spell user, so that with a limit of 2/5, a group of five characters could have two pure spell users, a pure spell user and two semi spell users, or four semi spell users.<br>A good method of controlling magical power is to limit the availability of spell lists. If you eliminate (or severely restrict the availability of) most of the spell lists that are useful in combat, <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Fighter">Fighters</a> and <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Warrior_Monk">Warrior Monks</a> will become more important. You can limit the availability of spells that aid in movement and stealth to make <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Thief">Thieves</a> and <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Rogue">Rogues</a> more useful.</p>
<h4><a name="SoHK_10.0.0.2">10.0.0.2</a> MAGICAL DEPENDENCE</h4>
<p>Perhaps you don't want to put absolute (or even minor) restrictions on the availability of magic, or maybe your players learn all the magic that they can and use their spells to solve every problem or obstacle they face. This can get boring rather quickly, not only for the GM, but especially for any non spell users in the group. One way to deal with this is to make their strength into a weakness.<br>
An obvious way to prevent players from relying solely on magic is to send them to an area where magic doesn't work. There are a couple problems with this approach, however. First of all, it can make the spell users feel pretty useless, even when used sparingly, solving one problem by creating another. Secondly, it is a simplistic solution that does not restore the balance between the professions, and it can't be used all the time without throwing magic out of the game entirely.<br>A better solution is to vary magic. The power of magic can ebb and flow like the tides, perhaps dependent on celestial bodies or some other natural process. It can also vary from place to place, being near impossible to use in some areas and wildly powerful in others. This change in magic can be reflected by modifications to casting, such as required Spell Casting static maneuvers in low-magic conditions. If you are using risk factors, a modification can be given to the Risk Factor Table based on the power of magic at a particular place or time. However you do it, it will increase the need for non spell users, and make the spell users rely on non-magical skills more, since those skills will be more reliable.<br>The creatures from the Magical Risk Factors chart can be used without the chart. They can cause problems for spell users, especially if they aren't expecting such monsters. I f you don't use risk factors on a regular basis, your players aren't going to be checking for the presence of Thausps and Magocites every day. You could even create other creatures, with resistance or immunity to certain types of magic. Just as certain races get bonuses against magical attacks, you can give special bonuses to various creatures to further confound your players.<br>Magical traps are another possibility. There are spells in <em>Spell Law</em> that are triggered by other spells. These could be used to design mechanical traps that are triggered by the use of magic.<br>As always, be careful. If you constantly block your characters with things they have no ability to defeat, they will get bored quickly and find another GM. However, using the above techniques judiciously can keep your players on their toes, and bring about a broader, richer gaming experience.</p>
<h2><a name="SoHK_10.1">10.1</a> Expanded Risk Factors</h2>
<p>The risk factors given in <em>Character Law</em> (<a href="5806.html#ChL_10.8">Section 10.8</a>, p.112) assume a concentrated source of great evil that actively searches for spell users. This is appropriate for worlds such as Tolkien's Middle-earth, but it is not appropriate for all worlds.<br>This section gives two optional methods for dealing with risk factors. The first is an Environmental Risk Chart, which assumes that the forces of nature react strongly to the power released in a when spells are cast. The other is a Distributed Evil Risk Chart, which assumes that a disorganized group of evil entities exist. These evil entities have different goals and may work at cross purposes, but they all pose a pervasive threat to a careless spell user.</p>
<h4><a name="SoHK_10.1.0.1">10.1.0.1</a> USING THESE CHARTS</h4>
<p>These charts (on the next two pages) are used just like the Spell Use Risk Chart in <em>Character Law</em> (p.113). When a character casts a spell, the GM should make an open-ended roll and add the risk factor for the spell's type. (For information on spell types, see <em>RMFRP</em> p. 154.) The risk factor can be determined from the risk factor section on the Environmental Risk Chart and the Distributed Evil Risk Chart by cross indexing the spell type and the risk level. The risk level is determined by the chart and the GM's sense of the situation. If the modified result is 100 or more, some form of reaction is triggered. A second open-ended roll is made and compared to the appropriate risk chart.<br>The results on the risk charts are guidelines to help a Gamemaster determine the consequences of the spell's power. The GM should feel free to modify these results to fit the specific time, area, and/or circumstances.</p>
<h4><a name="SoHK_10.1.0.2">10.1.0.2</a> NEW MONSTER INFORMATION</h4>
<p><strong>Magosites:</strong> amnhkstw-(-),FM,AR,CDHJP-5; 0.05"-.75"</p>
<p>Magosites are small parasitic arachnids, related to ticks. They live off certain frequencies of magical energy. This does not negatively affect spells cast by their host, as the Magosite waste products add to other frequencies. However, this does set up a resonance in the spells cast, making them easier to detect. Any attempt to detect the host's spells, or the host himself while he is casting a spell, gets +10 for each Magosite on the host. This includes RRs to passive spells, to see if the target detects the spell's effect. This modification is also applied to any rolls on the Spell Use Risk Chart (<em>Character Law</em>, p.113) or the Distributed Evil Risk Chart.<br>Magosites are well armored and very tough. They are excellent climbers, and can fit through the narrowest of cracks. They climb up on ceilings on in trees, and drop down when they sense the energies of a spell user below them. A starving Magosite may even drop on any heat source, hoping to be carried to a source of magical energy. They do no physical damage to their host, merely hanging on. Each full day that the host uses no magic, there is a cumulative 10% chance that the Magosite will drop off and look for better food.<br>A Magosite can be detected by a close search of the whole body, though they tend to hide in hairy areas where they are hard to find. A successful Meditation maneuver at the end of the day will notice the effects of a Magosites presence. This will only work if the Magosite had an effect during that day (changed the result type on a Risk Factor chart, made a detection succeed where it would have other- wise failed, and so on).</p>
<p><strong>Thausps:</strong> hnwmk-(-),M(-,-)-3.</p><p>The nature of Thausps are not very well known. Some argue that they are relatives of the Will of the Wisp and the Mist Monster, while others think they are ghosts of certain spell casters or Macruls.<br>
What is known is that Thausps are invisible, floating spirits that feed on magical energy. They hang around a spell user, maneuvering in the path of any spells he casts. This makes the spells less effective. For each Thausp around a spell user, RRs against his spells get a special +10 bonus. Elemental attacks get a special penalty of -10. Note that each Thausp can only absorb one spell each round.<br>The presence of a Thausp (although not the number present) can be detected by a Meditation maneuver, as described for Magosites. To get rid of a Thausp, the host can either not cast spells or perform a Cleansing Ritual. For each day without spell casting, there is a cumulative 10% chance that a Thausp will leave in search of better food. A successful Cleansing Ritual will get rid of one Thausp, butthe maneuver is at a -10 penalty for each Thausp beyond the first.</p>
<p><strong>Maglins:</strong> (asf)-(-.-,-,-)-5.</p><p>Maglins are a distant relative of the fey races. They are much smaller than their distant cousins the Gremlins, standing only 2"-3" in height. They are extremely quick for their size, being able to keep up with a jogging humanoid for short periods. None can rival the stealth of a Maglin, who will typically hide in a pack or bag to hitch rides near spell users.<br>Maglins are malicious creatures who live on the foundational energies of magic. By eating away at the foundations of spells, they make them more likely to fail. Each time a spell is cast within 25' of a Maglin, the GM should make a second failure roll. The spell fails if the second failure roll is equal to or less than the number of Maglins within 25' of the caster.<br>Maglins can be detected by a Meditation maneuver just like Magosites, and have the same chance of wandering off if no spells are cast within 25' of them. They must still be found after their presence is detected, and once found they are exceedingly hard to catch. Their high speed and small size combine with a smooth skin, giving them the ability to get away from almost any pursuit or capture.</p>
<p><strong>Macrul:</strong> (-)-EN§#,(-,-,-)-7</p><p>Macrul are often confused with Vampires, although they are acompletely different type of creature, with different strengths and vulnerabilities. They are Class IV Undead, the continuing bodies of drained spell users. They retain the spell casting abilities they had in life. Macrul come from all three realms, although the higher level Macrul tend to be <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Mentalist">Mentalists</a>.<br>Macrul attack by stealthily approaching a target spell user. Once they are within 10 feet, they perform a magic ritual that takes about one minute. The character may resist the ritual, and if they resist by more than 30 they know that some sort of magic was used on them. A successful Spell Lore maneuver will allow them to determine the source of the spell. If the ritual is not resisted, the target loses one level for the purposes of casting spells. If the target drops to level 0 for spell casting, he must make a RR vs. disease each day, against the level of the Macrul. Failure means they die, and become a Macrul in service of their creator.<br>The ritual can only be performed once per day, and a Macrul will try to follow the spell user and perform the ritual whenever it gets the chance. Fortunately, Macrul are spatially bound, and may not go more than 1 mile per level from their home. The effects of the Macrul's attack can be healed through rest. For each full day of rest, the target may make a RR vs. disease at the level of the Macrul. Success means that one level is regained.<br>The main vulnerability of a Macrul is bronze, and bronze weapons are treated as slaying against them. However, their affinity for magic makes them immune to enchanted weapons. To permanently kill a Macrul, one must bury it in a graveyard with its hands and legs bound in bronze and it must be gagged with bronze coins in its mouth.</p>
<p><strong>Demons</strong></p><p>Of all the extra-planar entities found throughout the cosmos, Demons are the most malevolent. Demons can be encountered with a wide variety of forms and powers. Many of the more powerful Demons love to tempt spell users with promises of magical power, only to turn on them when they least expect it. Demons seduce unwary spell users with lies, trickery and forbidden knowledge. Unless compelled by magic, a Demon will never help a character, and will always seek to corrupt or destroy him, even if bound by the tightest of spells. Demons love to give spell users gifts of power and magic. These gifts invariably bring about the doom of the unfortunate recipient. Demons seem to enjoy the act of betrayal above all other sins.</p><img src="../shared/5808/C/Environmental_Risk.png" width="300" alt="&copy; ICE">
<img src="../shared/5808/C/Distributed_Evil_Risk.png" width="300" alt="&copy; ICE">
<p>Not all Demons possess great magic. and not all Demons are clever enough to trick mortal spell users into accepting their gifts. Demons who are armed with both magic and intelligence are grouped into lesser. major and greater status.<br>Lesser Demons are prone to attack spell users outright in the hopes that they can steal their magic from their dismembered corpses. These Demons include Daedhel. Culrang. and Daerauk.<br>Major Demons are more crafty, and will often disguise themselves before approaching their prey, hoping to trick them into low- ering their guard before they strike. These Demons include Gogonaur. Narauk, Thauredhel, and the unnamed Demons of the Fourth Pale. Greater Demons are extremely crafty. and will often be accompanied by mortal and demonic servants who will help them harass the spell user and his companions. Their deceptions span centuries, and they are seldom outwitted by mere mortals. Spell users who attract the attention of a greater Demon may be hunted for years before the final trap is sprung. Greater Demons who torment spell users include Celebdel. Noble Gogonaur, Raukamar, Moloch. and the unnamed Demons of the Fifth Pale.<br>Details of these and more Demons can be found in <em>Creatures & Monsters</em>. Section 9.0.</p>
<p><strong>Cultists</strong></p>
<p>There are several reasons why a cult may be interested in spell users. They may be the worshipers of a Demon or Macrul, who requires them to find and sacrifice spell users. Some cults believe that eating the brain or other organs of a spell user transfers power and immortality. and may ally themselves with those who can sense magic to track down spell users.<br>
Whatever reason the GM determines for the cultist, the individual cultist will be of a level comparable to the spell user they detected. They will typically use stealth to approach, and then try to separate the spell user from any companions. The spell user will then be carried off, to be used in some form of ritual.<br>When a whole cult is indicated, they should be a group of comparable power to the detected spell user and his companions. They will attempt to ambush the player characters, separate out the spell users, and make off with them for later use in a ritual.</p>
<h2><a name="SoHK_10.2">10.2</a> Resistance as skills</h2>
<p>Spell users have many natural advantages over non spell users in Rolemaster. Not only can they cast all kinds of spells, but they are also better able to resist the effects of magic. All characters add their stat bonuses to their resistance rolls. Spell users have a natural advantage in this regard, since they must have at least a 90 in their realm stat. Thus, a Magician has at least a +15 bonus to his resistance roll by virtue of the fact that he has at least a 90 in his Empathy stat. Non spell users, who often ignore Empathy, Intuition and Presence in favor of "more useful" stats have an inherent disadvantage when it comes to resisting the effects of magic.<br>To counter this effect, the Gamemaster might consider introducing a new skill category called Resistance. In this skill category, there would be one skill for each type of resistance roll that a character might face. These would usually include resistance rolls against Essence, Channeling and Mentalism magic, as well as poison, disease and fear. The existence of this skill category assumes that a character is able to train himself to consciously bolster his natural defenses, granting him increased resistance to a variety of harmful effects, including magic.<br>It is also assumed that when a character learns how to cast spells, he opens himself up to the magical energies that he is trained to use. When he does this, it becomes much harder for him to learn to resist those energies, because he has taken steps to draw them into himself so he can control them. Any character who knows any spells in a realm of magic develops the Resistance skill for that realm as a restricted skill.<br>The development point cost for the Resistance skill category is:</p>

<li><p>A character may use a Resistance skill as a 50% activity action in the snap action phase. He must make a Resistance static maneuver modified by his Resistance skill bonus. The difficulty of the static maneuver is determined by the percentage of his Resistance skill bonus that the character wishes to apply towards his resistance rolls (see the Resistance Difficulty Chart).<br>If the maneuver is successful, 60-120% (depending upon the difficulty of the maneuver) of the character's skill bonus is applied to each appropriate RR he must make during the round.</p></li>

<blockquote id="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Gorenac bravely marches towards the Orc Sorcerer. As he approaches, he notices that the Orc begins to chant the spidery words of magic. Thinking quickly, Gorenac declares that he will attempt a Channeling Resistance maneuver in the snap action phase of the current round. He fears that the Sorcerer will place a curse on him, so he plans to try for 90% of his Channeling Resistance bonus &mdash; a Very Hard (-20) maneuver. He rolls a 91. With his 13 ranks (+36) in Channeling Resistance and 9 ranks in the Resistance skill category total bonus o f +54, his final result is (91 + 54 - 2 0 = 125) a Success! He gains a bonus o f (54 x 90% = 46.8 = 47) to his Channeling RRs for the rest of this round. Unfortunately, the Sorcerer throws a Confusion spell on him (Closed Essence) and his resistance bonus is wasted since it only applies to Channeling spells.<br>A few rounds later, Gorenac recovers from the Confusion and prepares to face his enemy again. This time he s wise to the Sorcerer's evil tricks, and he opts to use his Resistance category bonus so he can resist both realms ofmagic. He takes a 10% action in the snap action phase and automatically gains a (18 &div; 2 = 9) bonus to his RRs for this round. He grins, knowing that his skill has aided him in his fight against evil magic.

<h2><a name="SoHK_10.3">10.3</a> Spell Visibility</h2>
<p>What does a spell look like? How does a Channeling spell differ from an Essence spell? When Spell Lore skill is used to identify an enemy spell caster, what is being looked for?<br>The RM spell system does not definitively address these questions. The visual effects of magical spells have been left to the imagination of each GM. These optional rules present descriptions of magical effects for all magic, and present some options for incorporating these visual effects. The focus here is to present magical spell effects that are flashy and spectacular. These effects clearly mark the spell caster for what he is, and allow his enemies to locate him much more easily. If the rules for risk factors are being used, the GM may want to modify the risk factor by +10 (<span id="mentalism">Mentalism</span> spells), +25 (<span id="essence">Essence</span> spells), or +50 (<span id="channeling">Channeling</span> and <span id="arcane">Arcane</span> spells).</p>
<h4><a name="SoHK_10.3.0.1">10.3.0.1</a> SPELL VISIBILITY EFFECTS</h4>
<p>All spells, no matter what realm of magic they are from, generate visible and spectacular effects when cast. These effects are primarily composed of bright lights that illuminate the spell caster, but they are also often accompanied by loud and varied sounds. While the spell caster is preparing a spell, a glowing nimbus surrounds his hands, face or body. When the spell is cast, enchanted streams of light fly forth from the caster's hands and mouth, surrounding the target and illuminating the spell effect. Any spell that creates a non permanent effect continues to glow throughout its duration. The caster also glows, in the same color, as long as the spell is in effect. These visual effects can even be seen through invisibility, so that an invisible spell caster is made visible by his magic.<br>In general, a spell's type determines its degree of visibility. Force and elemental spells are the most visible of all magic spells. The descriptions below represent spells of these types. Passive spells are much less visible, possessing only a fraction (about 10%) of the visible effects that are seen in force and elemental spells. A careful observer will still be able to notice a passive spell, but others will need to make a Hard Awareness maneuver to notice anything. Utility spells are easier to notice than passive spells, but still only about half as flashy as force or elemental spells. No one would miss a utility spell in action unless they failed a Light Awareness maneuver. Information spells are the least noticeable, and the visual effects of a spell of this type are limited to the caster, who usually glows softly while the spell is cast.<br>Instantaneous spells are not immune to these visible effects, but their very nature often means that the effects are short-lived. If an instantaneous spell produces an effect that lasts longer than a round, the visual display will surely betray the use of magic. A Deflections spell only causes a brief flash of light and a sound like a small firecracker, while a Shield spell creates a shimmering effect throughout its duration.</p>
<blockquote id="option">
<strong>Option:</strong> With magic so colorful and obvious, one wonders how an Illusionist could ever fool anyone. To keep illusions from becoming worthless, the GM may decide that Illusionists have learned how to cloak the power of their spells. Spells on the Illusionist base lists (and possibly other Illusion and Phantasm spells) would not be affected by these rules. (Alternatively, Illusionists could learn Spell Trickery as an everyman, or even occupational, skill. See below.)<br>Similarly, some spells (such as Invisibility, Shadow, and Change to Kind) should not be affected by these rules, unless the GM wants to make these spells practically worthless. The GM may decide that these type of spells still generate flashy effects when they are cast, but that the magical radiance does not persist while the spell is in effect.
</blockquote>
<p><strong><span id="essence">Essence</span></strong></p>
<p>When an Essence spell caster casts a spell. he flings his arms about and chants audibly in the tongue-twisting words of magic. Softly glowing strands of light seem to fade into being out of the ground. the plants. and the very air around him. These strands flow in. whistling softly like hissing sparks. and are gathered together by the spell caster as he prepares his spell. As the spell nears readiness. the glowing energy collects between the caster's hands in a form suggestive of the final spell effect. When the spell is cast. these lights are flung toward the target with a high-pitched whine like a shrieking lightning bolt. When the caster is the target. they envelope the caster and infuse him with their magical power.<br>A <em>Fire Bolt</em> gathers together as a bright flame of reddish light before being fired at the intended target. A <em>Telekinesis</em> spell wraps gossamer-thin tendrils of greenish energy about the object being moved. A <em>Teleport</em> consumes the targets in a bright flash of magical energy and a sonic boom that can be heard several miles away.</p>
<p><strong><span id="channeling">Channeling</span></strong></p>
<p>Channeling spell casters raise their hands up to the heavens and call out to their deity in loud supplication. As they prepare their spells. the clouds seem to part. and glowing motes of magical light drift down from on high. In the distance. all who observe the spell can hear a faint chorus of angelic voices and trumpets. As the spell nears completion. a glowing column of light encircles the caster. bathing him in a holy radiance. When the spell is finally bestowed upon the target. the radiance transfers to them. and all who view them are transfixed by the glorious light within. Enemies of the caster's faith are burned and blinded by the righteous glory of his deity. and the radiance of the spell causes them spiritual pain. (At the GM's discretion. they might take more damage. but this is intended to be just an effect. At worst. they are more determined to destroy the spell caster.)<br>Channeling spell users who worship evil deities fling themselves about. uttering curses and demands for power. Darkly glowing embers seem to rise up from the ground. darting about like red-hot bees. From deep in the earth below. the sounds of muffled cries and screams of terror and rage can be heard. When the spell is complete. the magical embers fly towards the target and seem to burrow themselves into his flesh.<br>A healing spell causes the caster to glow with a soothing radiance that is transferred to the target when the spell is cast. An Absolution strikes the target to the depth of his soul with the deity's holy (or unholy) power. Information spells in the Channeling realm are more visible than other realms: as a spell user casts an Intuitions spell. he is bathed softly in his deity's light as he communes quietly with his god.</p>
<p><strong><span id="mentalism">Mentalism</span></strong></p>
<p>Mentalism spells have relatively subdued effects. but they are still visible to those who know what to look for. As a Mentalism spell caster prepares his spell. his eyes begin to glow with a magical light. His hair and features take on an unnatural hue. and his body seems to generate a strange radiance from within. As the spell nears completion. his blood vessels become visible. as his bones become luminescent. lighting up like powerful lamps. When the spell is released. the glowing energies concentrate in his temple and burst forth. infusing the target with the same radiance that recently possessed the spell caster.<br>A <em>Bladeturn</em> spell causes the caster's eyes and the attacking weapon to glow briefly. A <em>Haste</em> spell causes the caster to glow like a brilliantly magical being throughout the duration of the spell. As he moves. tendrils of light blur behind him, following his motion. A <em>Mind Tongue</em> spell manifests as a subdermal glow that illuminates the skull of both the caster and the target for a time.</p>
<p><strong><span id="arcane">Arcane</span></strong></p>
<p>Arcane spell casters chant audibly and raise their arms in sweeping motions. as though they were drawing magical power up from the earth. As they prepare their spells. glowing strands of energy seem to rise up from the ground as though commanded by the spell caster's will. The ground trembles. and a great grinding sound is felt more than heard. beneath the feet of the observers. The strands of energy encircle the caster and dive into his body. infusing his flesh with vibrant energy. He glows from within as he is filled with the power he commands. As the spell is cast. the energy bursts forth in a blinding display of power. causing all that it touches to glow faintly.<br>Bladerunes glow for hours after they are enchanted. and when they are activated. the magical energy seems to burst forth like a torrent of water. A <em>Mana Ball</em> is a blinding explosion of energy. in all colors of the rainbow. that can be seen and heard for miles. A <em>Void Bolt</em> is a deeply disturbing well of utter darkness. At the edges of the visual effect. all color and light seems to blur into distorted forms. as though the fabric of perception were falling away into a dark well. Fortunately. the effect does not last for long.</p>
<h4><a name="10.3.0.2">10.3.0.2</a> OBSERVATIONS</h4>
<p>The net effect of these rules is to make magic a much less subtle ability. Characters can still <em>Teleport</em> into a castle. but they will lose any chance of sneaking into the king's chamber unnoticed. These rules will affect some spell users more than others. A Healer doesn't really care if people notice that he is helping the wounded. but a <a href="../en.lproj/professions.html#Dabbler">Dabbler</a> would be very worried if the guard saw him casting <em>Charm Kind</em> on the king.<br>There are some advantages to these effects as well. Every spell can be used as a <em>Light</em> spell. This cannot easily be avoided. but if spells do not illuminate much. then Light spells will still be useful. One option would be to vary the degree of these effects by the level of the spell. Perhaps a spell only illuminates 5 feet per level. so a spell user would have to cast a 10th level spell to obtain the visual range of a 1st level Projected Light spell.<br>Another advantage is that spells could certainly look and sound more impressive than they often are. A lowly spell user could cast a simple <em>Aura</em> spell and intimidate a whole company of Orcs. The GM might prefer to allow clever players to use such a ruse. If not. then one could reason that if all magic works this way. then most people would be familiar with spell effects and the average Orc wouldn't be fooled by a flashy. yet ineffective spell.<br>If the Gamemaster decides to use spell visibility. then he might consider including a skill in the <a href="../en.lproj/skills.html#Power_Manipulation">Power Manipulation</a> skill category called Spell Trickery. This skill could be used to mask some of the visible effects of spell casting. giving the stealthy spell user a chance to avoid detection. Suggested difficulties for masking a spell using Spell Trickery are given below. Further details on the Spell Trickery skill can be found in the <em>Essence Companion</em>.</p>
